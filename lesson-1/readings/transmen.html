        <p>This article examines the experiences of 25 persons who were assigned female status at birth but do not wish to live as women and take on a masculine or queer gender identity. We employ the concept of 'gendered embodiment' and introduce the concept of 'sexualized embodiment' to highlight what is involved in this process. We ask how experiencing a masculine gender identity is reflexively tied to a trans man's sexuality and the ways in which these two embodiments are tightly, moderately, or loosely coupled. For example, a tight coupling appeared when trans men began to use testosterone and obtained surgery such as breast removal; a moderate coupling was found where gender validation was sought from a sexual partner (with this being related to sexual preference identities as well as the interpretation of vaginal penetration); the loosest coupling of the gender-sexuality embodiments was linked to the liberality of the locale and whether 'queer' identities could be easily adopted. In sum, our research demonstrates the link between gender and sexuality as a result of the body work trans men do and the historical and geographical situations in which they find themselves. <cite>[ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]</cite></p>

        <p><h2>Trans Men: Embodiments, Identities, and Sexualities.</h2></p>


        <p style="margin-top: 0;">This article examines the experiences of 25 persons who were assigned female status at birth but do not wish to live as women and take on a masculine or queer gender identity. We employ the concept of "gendered embodiment" and introduce the concept of "sexualized embodiment" to highlight what is involved in this process. We ask how experiencing a masculine gender identity is reflexively tied to a trans man's sexuality and the ways in which these two embodiments are tightly, moderately, or loosely coupled. For example, a tight coupling appeared when trans men began to use testosterone and obtained surgery such as breast removal; a moderate coupling was found where gender validation was sought from a sexual partner (with this being related to sexual preference identities as well as the interpretation of vaginal penetration); the loosest coupling of the gender‐sexuality embodiments was linked to the liberality of the locale and whether "queer" identities could be easily adopted. In sum, our research demonstrates the link between gender and sexuality as a result of the body work trans men do and the historical and geographical situations in which they find themselves.</p>

        <p>embodiment; gender; reflexivity; sexuality; transgender; trans men</p>

        <p>Researchers of human sexuality are increasingly showing how sociologically complex this form of human conduct can be. One consistent theme that has appeared is how the taken‐for‐granted combinations of biological sex, gender, and sexual behaviors do not hold for certain groups. Early studies such as Humphreys' ([<a href="#ref26">26</a>] ) on "tea rooms" described heterosexually married men who did not self‐define as gay or bisexual engaging in sex with other men. Later work showed this to be but one manifestation of this phenomenon. Thus, Ward's ([<a href="#ref62">62</a>] ) more recent study of "dude sex" further challenged the taken‐for‐granted naive understanding of sex, gender, and sexuality and the links between them. She described how sex between men can be interpreted as "not gay" and how this is accomplished through reframing it through race and "racialized culture." In addition, sexuality is rendered even more complex when the material body is added to the mix of gender and sexuality. This mix can be seen in the emerging sociological work on trans phenomena (Hines [<a href="#ref24">24</a>] , [<a href="#ref25">25</a>] ; Taylor, Hines, and Casey [<a href="#ref59">59</a>] ).</p>


        <p>Trans persons are people who feel that their body is misaligned with the gender assigned at birth (Beemyn and Rankin [<a href="#ref1">1</a>] ), thereby calling into question the dominant culture's assumption of symmetry between biological sex and social gender. To further muddy matters, the dominant culture also makes an assumption about people's sexual interest—viz., that a person will be attracted to the other sex. Thus, there is the widespread adoption of what has come to be called the "coat rack" model whereby gender differences are thought to automatically follow from the anatomical differences between males and females (Nicholson [<a href="#ref35">35</a>] ), as well as the sex/gender they will be sexually attracted to.</p>


        <p>If the gender transition of trans people is difficult for a great many people to understand, then trans sexuality can be even more confusing. Thus, for example, the average person may wonder if an individual "born female", but who believes he is a man, will be sexually attracted to men or women. The answer to this question has been a subject for debate especially among professionals in medicine and psychology (Schleifer [<a href="#ref51">51</a>] ). So, for instance, is a trans man (a person who is born biologically female) who is sexually attracted to men to be considered "heterosexual" (Chivers and Bailey [<a href="#ref9">9</a>] ) or "homosexual" (Coleman, Bockting, and Gooren [<a href="#ref10">10</a>] )? The answer will depend on whether an essentialist (based on biological sex) or a constructionist (based on the actor's subjectivity) perspective is adopted. Researchers of trans phenomena have increasingly come to use the constructionist perspective—with an interest in the role of trans agency and the work trans people do to accomplish a gendered self. Central to this work, as Schleifer ([<a href="#ref51">51</a>] ) has noted, is that sex, gender, and sexuality are mutually constitutive.</p>

        <p>How one group of trans people (viz., 25 trans men) have deployed material (bodily), discursive (interpretive), and (social) interactional resources in doing sexuality, and how it relates to gender identity, is the focus of this article. More specifically, the article considers the role of the body in accomplishing both a gendered self and a sense of sexual competence, and how the social milieu mediates such processes through providing interpretive frameworks and social supports. </p>

        <p>To guide this investigation, we make use of the concept of "embodiment", made famous by Bourdieu ([<a href="#ref4">4</a>] ). We separate it into two types: "gendered embodiment" and "sexualized embodiment" (Plummer [<a href="#ref42">42</a>] ). The body can be experienced in practical ways (Giddens [<a ref="#ref21">21</a>] ) and also in the mode of what Crossley ([<a href="#ref12">12</a>] ) refers to as "reflexive embodiment", the ability to reflect upon and change bodily habits. In turn, he maintains that "embodiment" can be used in research through a focus on "body techniques". Not only do such techniques incorporate practical understandings, but also situations can be defined and meanings conferred through them (Crossley [<a href="#ref13">13</a>] ).</p>


        <p>"Gendered embodiment" points to the way in which gendered practices become a set of bodily techniques understood and recognized as "doing gender" (West and Zimmerman [<a href="#ref70">70</a>] ). So, for example, Young ([<a href="#ref74">74</a>] ) has analyzed "throwing like a girl", whereby women's physical capacities are thwarted through their incorporation of the female gender habitus. "Sexualized embodiment" has been less attended to, but Plummer ([<a href="#ref42">42</a>] :526) sees it as "doing body work around sex"—for example, how we experience one's own and other bodies, do erotic body work in gyms, dancing, or courtship, and the like. Not only does sexualized embodiment take the form of unconscious bodily techniques in "doing sexuality", but it becomes reflexive as well, as we dwell on what we do (cf. Weinberg and Williams [<a href="#ref68">68</a>] ). This is further theorized in the work of Jackson and Scott ([<a href="#ref28">28</a>] , [<a href="#ref29">29</a>] ) who in describing forms of sexualized embodiment connect bodily techniques with Gagnon and Simon's ([<a href="#ref20">20</a>] ) theory of sexual scripts.</p>

        <p>We have noted Schleifer's ([<a href="#ref51">51</a>] ) view of the mutual constitution of sexuality and gender. This article examines this phenomenon by looking at the embodied aspects of both gender and sexuality among trans persons. We are assisted in this by the earlier work of Richardson ([<a href="#ref46">46</a>] ). She suggests that the links between gender and sexuality can be weaker or stronger, unidirectional or not. We conceptualize the relationship between the two embodiments as one that can range from being "tightly coupled" to "loosely coupled". A "tight connection" is one that strongly links sexualized embodiment and gendered embodiment. A "moderately coupled" situation would involve a less‐strong connection, one more open to mitigating factors. For example, a man may have sex partners who fail to support his embodied gender by challenging his sexual performance. Finally, a "loosely coupled" situation can involve a whole host of mitigating factors that affect the relationship between the embodiments. A person may reject notions of gender altogether or invent new forms of gender. Similarly, they may adopt unique sexual practices that have ambiguous gender implications.</p>

        <p>The taken‐for‐granted link between gendered and sexualized embodiment is made problematic by trans people. The very existence of trans persons directly undermines naturalizing accounts of gender and sexuality as trans‐embodiments divorce the assumed connection between bodies, genders, and sexuality. Gendered embodiment has been studied in the case of trans individuals. For example, this includes early studies like Devor's ([<a href="#ref14">14</a>] ) examination of "gender blending", Prosser's ([<a href="#ref43">43</a>] ) phenomenological analysis of bodily transformation, and Rubin's ([<a href="#ref48">48</a>] ) account of body dysphoria and the construction of gender identity. A more recent study that examined how persons used their bodies and gave themselves a subjective sense of gender identity, is Schrock, Reid, and Boyd's ([<a href="#ref52">52</a>] ) work on trans women (persons assigned male status at birth who see themselves as and come to live as women). Here, individuals were shown to do body work that retrained, redecorated, and reshaped their physical bodies, consequently bringing their feelings, attitudes, and self‐concept into alignment with their gender identities.</p>

        <p>There have been, however, comparatively few studies of sexualized embodiment among trans people. Most work has been on the relationship between sexuality and gender in connection with the issue of what sex preference identity trans people adopt. The early work of Devor ([<a href="#ref14">14] , [<a href="#ref15">15</a>] ) found that the trans men in her study group had an enduring preference for women before and after transition, which confirmed their identities as men (and as heterosexual). After transitioning, a large minority also grew increasingly attracted to men, especially gay men (and defined as gay or bisexual). In the latter case, a large part of the attraction was based on the opportunity to learn how to act sexually as a man—especially knowledge of "the penis in action"—a direct reference to sexualized embodiment. </p>

        <p>Rubin's ([<a href="#ref48">48</a>] ) study found that many trans men first identified as lesbians and needed to engage in "disidentification" from that group, especially as trans identities became available. Trans men explained their lesbian sojourn as a mistake or detour and wanted to clarify that their attraction to women was from the point of view of their being men (viz., heterosexual men) and not lesbians. Also, as in Devor's study group, they saw a kinship with gay men and in this instance their homosexual attraction was used as confirmation of their identities as men. Other important studies, especially those that directly related sexuality and gender validation, have been published by Lee ([<a href="#ref32">32</a>] ), Dozier ([<a href="#ref17">17</a>] ), Sanger ([<a href="#ref49">49</a>] ), and Schleifer ([<a href="#ref51">51</a>] ).</p>

        <p>Rubin's work is important because he grounded his work in the specific geographical and historical context in which this identity work was being done. In the 1970s, lesbian communities in large cities like San Francisco became politically engaged with feminism and sought to only include "women identified women" in their ranks. This meant conflict with the trans men who also were attracted to women, but identified as men. The resulting "border wars" (Halberstam [<a href="#ref23">23</a>] ) meant most trans men were excluded from lesbian communities with the consequence that they had to construct an identity and community of their own. Originally, this centered on heterosexual trans men, but in the 1980s also included gay trans men.</p>

        <p>The importance of historical context is shown in the recent research of Beemyn and Rankin ([<a href="#ref1">1</a>] ). Their large study group included both trans men and trans women, cross‐dressers, gender queers, and so forth, as well as others with no binary identity whom they refer to as "different gender". They observed a generational change occurring that had been aided by the internet. Thus, younger trans men, who had easier access not only to information but also to supportive others were found either to never have identified as lesbians or, if so, for a much briefer time. Overall, too, the study found trans men to "come out" at an earlier age than in the past, suggesting a shorter time of identity confusion. This experience itself may be less traumatic as the profusion of identities available and the realization that sex preference is not immutable over one's life span means that choice (if indeed one bothers having a sex preference identity at all) is a very different thing for trans people today.</p>

        <p>In sum, the aim of the present article is to investigate the ways in which a group of people who have moved away from a given gender identity can come to experience another gender identity and how this is embodied through their sexuality. Correspondingly, we ask in what way their sexuality reflects back on their gendered embodiment and identity. Thus, we see the link between gender and sexuality as a result of the body work trans men do, their social environments, and the historical and geographic situations in which they find themselves.</p>

        <p><h2>Methods Participants and Data Collection</h2></p>

        <p>We come to this topic as non‐trans sociologists, who have conducted previous research on unconventional forms of sex, sexuality, and gender.[<a href="#ref1">1</a>] We chose San Francisco as the locale for the research because our past work on sexual minorities in the city (see especially Weinberg et al.[<a href="#ref67">67</a>] ; Weinberg et al. [<a href="#ref66">66</a>] ; Weinberg and Williams [<a href="#ref69">69</a>] ) had made us aware of how it provides a social laboratory of sorts whereby various groups can explore unconventional genders and sexualities. This has been especially true for trans persons who find a supportive locale in a well‐established transgender community surrounded by a relatively liberal urban environment. Many of the sexual categories, roles, and institutions available in San Francisco that contribute to their transition are not available in other locales and therefore are part and parcel of being a trans man in this city (for an account of important events in the history of the trans phenomena in San Francisco, see Stryker [<a href="#ref57">57</a>] ). Thus, the findings we obtain for the trans men we studied are very much linked to the social context they are in.</p>

        <p>To ensure that a diverse group of trans‐identified participants within San Francisco would have the opportunity to participate, multiple recruitment strategies were used including face‐to‐face recruitment, recruitment through the use of flyers, and "snowball sampling" (study participants contacting additional people to participate). For face‐to‐face recruitment, participants were recruited at community venues where trans persons were likely to frequent, including service organizations and social spaces that welcomed trans people. Additionally, flyers that provided information about the study were posted, with the permission of management, at local commercial sites and venues, such as bars, sex clubs, medical, counseling, and legal clinics. These advertisements contained the cell phone number of one of the investigators whom individuals could contact to learn more about the study and help them decide whether to participate. Last, snowball sampling or what has been labeled modified respondent‐driven sampling (RDS), where recruited individuals are asked to find additional participants in their social network, was used to recruit study participants. This method has successfully been used to study hidden and marginalized populations: for example, Latino gay and bisexual men (Ramirez‐Valles et al. [<a href="#ref45">45</a>] ), injection drug users and sex workers (Platt et al. [<a href="#ref41">41</a>] ; Simic et al. [<a href="#ref54">54</a>] ), zoophiles (Williams and Weinberg [<a href="#ref71">71</a>] ), partners of trans persons (Pfeffer [<a href="#ref40">40</a>] ), and other hard‐to‐reach groups. Thus, individuals who were recruited in the other ways mentioned above were then asked to recruit additional participants from their social network. They provided these new potential informants with information on how to contact us if they were interested in being interviewed. This method included direct word of mouth as well as utilizing online community boards, blogs, and listservs by participants to post information about the study.</p>

        <p>The volunteers were asked to complete a structured face‐to face interview. We made it easier for them to participate by being willing to conduct the interviews at their residence if this was their desire and all but a few opted for using their home location. The rest were interviewed either in private areas of our residence buildings or unoccupied areas in cafés/restaurants.</p>

        <p>We asked each member of the study group the same questions—open‐ended questions about the history and current state of their transition—focusing on changes in their anatomy and physiology, gender roles, identities, employment, gendered and sexualized embodiments, social and sexual relationships, a variety of aspects of their sexuality, their involvement in and commitment to institutions in their community and the nation as a whole, and their physical and emotional health. The total interview time was approximately 60 minutes and participants were provided a $25 payment as a token of appreciation for their time. Study approval had been obtained from the Indiana University Bloomington Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from all participants. We received very vivid descriptions of gendered and sexualized embodiments from the study participants that are telling in demonstrating our theoretical conclusions.</p>

        <p>Using the above recruitment methods, we were able to obtain 50 trans people—the number we sought for our study. Half of the trans persons were trans men and half were trans women. In this article we focus on data from only the 25 trans men.[<a href="#ref2">2</a>] The ages of the study participants ranged from 20 to 65 with a median age of 39. The race/ethnic composition of the study group reflected the diversity found in the city. Thus, less than half reported they were white, one identified as Native American, one as Middle Eastern, one as Asian, one as African American, and one as Hispanic—the remaining eight describing themselves as a mixture of racial and ethnic backgrounds, for example, Jewish and African, Native American and Hispanic, white and Roma. Educationally, they all had gone beyond high school: 11 had attended some college, two had received an Associate's Degree from a 2‐year junior/community college, nine had a 4‐year college degree, one had an M.A. degree, and two had a Ph.D. degree. They had resided in San Francisco from 3 months to 48 years with a median time of 4 years: five had been living there for less than a year, five for 1–2 years, three for 3–5 years, three for 6–9 years, three for 10–20 years, and six for over 20 years.</p>

        <p><h2>Data Analysis</h2></p>
        <p>We read the text from the interviews and coded inductively, creating categories for all interesting themes encountered as we read and reread the transcripts (Emerson, Fretz, and Shaw [<a href="#ref18">18</a>] ; Glaser and Strauss [<a href="#ref22">22</a>] ). The analysis and conceptualization of the interview material focused on the study participants' experience of their body before and after their gender transition—namely in their physicality, their gender identity and expression, their sexual feelings, who they related to sexually, their sexual‐preference identity, the nature of their sexual interaction, and how all these aspects of lived experience intertwined.</p>

        <p>At the time of the interview, most of the trans men (23 of the 25) identified their gender identity as a man or some version of this categorization, for example, "transexual male", "trans guy", or "trans male". (Two, however, identified as "gender queer".) For most, then, their gender identity and presentation was some form of masculinity and traditional binary systems were usually the reference point in interpretations of their gendered and sexualized embodiments. We organize the results in terms of the degree of connection between their gendered and sexualized embodiments. The degree of these connections are discussed under the headings of "Tightly Coupled Embodiments", "Moderately Coupled Embodiments", and "Loosely Coupled Embodiments". It is an open question as to what factors determine the strength of the relationship between gendered and sexualized embodiments. One factor that we show to be prevalent throughout is the character of the local milieu—for example, its culture, opportunity structure, and identities. We will discuss how these collective factors intersect with interpersonal and intrapsychic ones in promoting or mitigating the degree to which gender and sexuality are connected through embodied practice.</p>

        <p><h2>Results Tightly Coupled Embodiments</h2></p>
        <p>This section illustrates instances where gendered and sexualized embodiments seemed closely connected to each other. That is, certain embodied aspects of sexuality appeared to clearly impinge on a sense of gender and vice versa.</p>

        <p><h2>Sexed Bodies</h2></p>
        <p>The starting point for transitioning for most of the trans men was their decision to take testosterone, which provides a clear example of what Jackson and Scott ([<a href="#ref29">29</a>] :148) term "sensate embodiment" to refer to the attribution of sexual meanings to physical body states.[<a href="#ref3">3</a>] In general, testosterone was said to create a more masculine sexualized embodiment through the enlargement of the clitoris, which trans men said made them feel like they had a penis. (Most, 21 of the 25, however, believed that one's genitalia did not define a person's gender.)</p>

        <p>Tim (all names are pseudonyms; the social characteristics of the persons in the study group are provided in Table [NaN] ) illustrated how this enlarged clitoris could be defined as a penis. In his words, "I had a pea‐sized clit before I started T [testosterone] and it grew 10‐fold, and now I have a dick that's the size of a gherkin… . The length is a good inch and a half…sometimes two inches depending whether I'm hard or not". Dennis said that the change in his clitoris had made it so that "I think of it as my cock or my dick". Patrick voiced this common experience when he said, "...the clitoral growth made me feel like I had a dick." However, not all trans men could make this interpretive leap. For example, despite clitoral enlargement, Christian said, "It's hard to be a man without a penis and balls."</p>

        <p>Transitioning could be complicated by another feature—namely, that testosterone does not affect breasts. Breasts were the most important signifier of female embodiment for the trans men and presented more of a problem than their female genitalia which were less visible. Of the 18 who reported any kind of surgical modification, most (<a href="#ref13">13</a>) said this was a double mastectomy (commonly referred to among trans persons as "top surgery"). Only two had had genital surgery (commonly referred to as "bottom surgery").</p>

        <p>Those who had the top surgery were pleased with its contribution to their transition (cf. Windsor [<a href="#ref72">72</a>] on similarities and differences between trans and non‐trans people who seek breast surgery). For example, Amad expressed that he was surprised by the "overwhelming relief" he felt after top surgery because "it really allowed me to experience myself as a male". He noted that the surgery produced a change in his sexualized embodiment, in that he now felt able to have a sexual relationship with a woman who self‐defined as heterosexual. As the case of Amad shows, top surgery meant that gendered embodiment could translate into sexualized embodiment. This was illustrated by trans men saying they now felt they were able to go to places like gay sex clubs without fear of rejection.</p>

        <p>Although the above examples show the tight relationship between the two embodiments, this was not always the case because there can be mitigating factors. For instance, testosterone had less of a physical effect on an older body, where secondary sexual characteristics have been long formed. Thus, Marcus said he was disappointed by the effects of hormones and referred to his "old body as a butch guy".</p>

        <p>The most important mitigating factor among the trans men in the study group was that their sexed body retained a vagina. Sometimes this was appraised in a negative way as a "trace reminder" of female embodiment (Johnson [<a href="#ref30">30</a>] :55). Thus, Lathe referred to his vagina as "this traitor body part", betraying his gender identity as a man. Similarly, Patrick wanted his vagina to be "sealed up" because it's a corporeal reminder of "… a moist environment down there…[that] just doesn't belong". Alternatively, a sense of masculinity could be attained by neutralizing the vagina by simply referring to it as a "hole". For example, Steven, as well as many of the other trans men, used the term "front hole" to label what before transition they called their "vagina". The limits of interpretive work were demonstrated, however, by Steven's trace reference that "…sensation around my front hole can remind me of... sex I had as a woman."</p>

        <p><h2>Sexual Urgency</h2></p>
        <p>Another example of a tight connection between gendered and sexualized embodiment was the new way sexuality was experienced and interpreted. Cultural notions of masculinity portray an incessant sexual urgency that is directed toward penetrating a partner with the aim of an explosive orgasm (cf. Gagnon and Simon [<a href="#ref20">20</a>] on the drive‐reduction model of sexuality). An increase in feeling sexual urgency was reported as being experienced by many trans men (also cf. Devor [<a href="#ref16">16</a>] ; Valerio [<a href="#ref60">60</a>] ).</p>

        <p>This increased sense of sexual urgency was often perceived in the framework of male sexuality. Christian referred to his increased sexual urgency as going way up so that "anything that moves was something I wanted to fuck... . I'd never had thoughts like that before". Most of the study group stated something similar. For example, Amad said that his sexuality had "...gone through the roof. I never had an orgasm before… . [Now] I jack off two to four times a day". Speed put it this way, "My [sexual] urges are a lot more impulsive...; if I wanna have sex, I wanna have sex right now". These reported changes were well summed up by Adam in this simile: "Men are like on–off switches, but women are like toasters—the elements have to heat up over a longer period".</p>

        <p>As well as experiencing a change in sexual urgency, some trans men spoke of a change in the nature of their orgasms, again interpreted as a qualitative break with their previous female embodiment. As Martin remarked, "It's a different orgasm now... . It's the [male] stereotype. They [male orgasms] are much more intense and much shorter…as opposed to the longer and deeper [female] sort of one". And Michael pined about losing the ability to have multiple orgasms: "I remember having multiple orgasms... . Now I just have one orgasm... . I cannot really have boom, boom—multiple orgasms". Dennis, like Martin (above), directly connected gendered and sexualized embodiment when he said, "I have more of an explosive orgasm [like genetic men]... but I also have more of a refractory period, like genetic men."</p>

        <p>In line with the above changes, a more masculine sexualized embodiment was also seen by trans men as they made sense of changes in the nature of the relationships they now pursued. These were often characterized as now being sexually focused, casual, and impersonal. For example, Tim noted, "I definitely like to have sex a lot more now for sex's sake and I'm not interested in maintaining any emotional connection with the people I have sex with". Nicholas said that relating to men had changed for him. "I want no personal connection with men when I sleep with them. I want to be really anonymous. With women [however] I can't just have casual sex with them". He said he would like to have similar impersonal relationships with women as he now had with men, but found this difficult because, as he put it, "I still have a female mind... but [then again] clearly I don't if I'm able to separate it from men". Matthew, who in talking about his sexual relationships said, "It's difficult for me to engage in anonymous sex or in sex with people I hardly know because I don't think I fit into the stereotype of what being a trans masculine person is". The above two cases again exemplify traces of a previous female embodiment, which represent a mitigating factor in the tightness of the coupling between gendered and sexualized embodiments. Overall, however, trans men seemed to connect these changes with what is often typified as the male approach to sex—that is, orgasm centered and emotionally indifferent (Connell [<a href="#ref11">11</a>] ; Taylor [<a href="#ref58">58</a>] ).</p>

        <p><h2>Moderately Coupled Embodiments</h2></p>
        <p>These are situations where the relationship between gendered and sexualized embodiments is more variable. For example, the trans man's gender identity either can be supported or challenged by his sexual partners and/or the types of sexual acts he engaged in.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Sexual Partner Validation</h3></p>
        <p>Another consideration in the trans man's sexualized embodiment is the extent to which his sexual interaction is conducted in a culturally defined masculine way. Thus, sex partners can reinforce his sense of being a man in the way they relate to him sexually (see Brown [<a href="#ref5">5</a>] ; Dozier [<a href="#ref17">17</a>] ; Ettner [<a href="#ref19">19</a>] ; O'Keefe and Fox [<a href="#ref37">37</a>] ). Jane Ward ([<a href="#ref63">63</a>] ), in a study of "femmes" relationships with trans men refers more generally to this type of supportive behavior as "gender labor", for example, routinized forms of care work that occur in addition to those linked to sexuality—like cooking, binding their partner's chest, and so forth—whereby the trans man's masculinity is validated.</p>

        <p>Sexual partners, however, may be difficult to find as well as keep. For, example many of the trans men reported that prior to transition they had partners who identified as lesbian (with the trans men at the time identifying as a "dyke" or "butch"). Their lesbian partners had to adapt to the trans man's body as it became more masculine. The partners often found it difficult to handle the loss of a "female" partner and to now treat the trans man as a man (cf. Nyamora [<a href="#ref36">36</a>] ; Pfeffer [<a href="#ref39">39</a>] ). Additionally, accompanying a trans man through transition often involved social and financial costs that sometimes imposed strains on the relationship.</p>

        <p>It was clear that regardless of the trans man's sexual preference identity, sexual partners were often involved in the validation of the trans men's gender identity. Lathe, who defined as a gay man, talked about his success in being accepted as a man when other gay men wanted to have sex with him. He noted that "... it's still bizarre to find someone who is interested in me not as a girl". Lucas, who defined as a straight‐queer, had been in a 1‐year relationship with a bio‐woman whom he described as very sexual ("we have sex at least once a day"). He said that she only used male pronouns to refer to him and called his genitalia a "cock", which he claimed had been very important in making him feel like a man.</p>

        <p>Heterosexual women partners could, though, pose problems related to the trans man's embodiment. If these women were unable or unwilling to define the trans man's female genitalia in any other way than female, trans men worried that they would see sex with them as lesbian sex. On the other hand, there was the contrasting concern that heterosexual women would reject them because they lacked a penis. This was, however, said to be less often an issue than the trans men had anticipated either because of the adventurous type of women who became involved with them, or that they found women were less interested in penises than they had assumed (cf. Pfeffer [<a href="#ref40">40</a>] ).</p>

        <p>Nonetheless, being sexually involved with a heterosexual woman could be validating for trans men who defined as straight. As Dennis commented in his interview, "Wow, if I can date these straight women, they really must have this [sexual] experience of me being a man". Amad also received validation as a man from a heterosexual woman. He noted how she was instrumental in his masculine sexualized embodiment "in the way she dealt with my penis [enlarged clitoris] like it was any other penis..." .</p>

        <p>Gay men, however, were the most popular partner choice among the trans men in the study group. According to them, gay men tended to accept trans men as a man more easily than other groups did and this validation was highly valued. Tim noted that generally trans men were able to fit into the gay community and that "Gays... having sex with me means they really do see me as a guy". In addition, gay sexuality was also reported as being "hot"—very direct, focused on orgasm, with little in the way of romantic requirements—in effect, the embodiment of "masculine sexuality". Thus, Steven had little ambivalence about what he did sexually with men. He discovered anal sex during his transition and now said he felt more like "a gay man [by] taking it up the butt". So, too, did Rick, who said he became more interested in learning about anal sex after he began publicly identifying as a man because "...it's something gay men did".</p>

        <p>Gay sex was far from a simple matter. The success of these interactions depended on whether the gay men accepted a man's body that lacked an ordinary‐size penis and had a "front hole" (cf. Devor [<a href="#ref16">16</a>] ; Schleifer [<a href="#ref51">51</a>] ). Sex with a trans man was also more likely to be acceptable to a gay man when it involved certain sexual acts—namely, with the trans man performing fellatio on or receiving anal penetration from the gay male partner. "Gay sex" of this kind also bolstered a trans men's sense of being a man by being treated as such during sexual encounters with gay men. As noted above, sometimes this involved the trans man's learning to appreciate receiving anal sex or finding gay men who enjoyed receiving fellatio from a trans man.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Penetration and Pleasure</h3></p>

        <p>As we have noted earlier, the retention of a vagina was potentially problematic for trans men—a trace reminder of a previous female embodiment. Most trans men handled this by not attending to its presence (helped by testosterone terminating menstruation). It came as a surprise when sex partners wanted to incorporate the trans man's vagina into their sexual activities. Even more of a surprise was that this desire came from some gay men (cf. Lee [<a href="#ref32">32</a>] ). The motivation for vaginal sex on the part of these men was seen by the trans men to be simply one of sexual pleasure. Thus, they saw gay men having an interest in the "novelty of the vagina" or simply that the vagina "...is a cock hole and it feels good for them". The motivation of sexual pleasure was extended to all men by Kevin, who was a sex worker. "It [vaginal sex] is how I make my money. Men like fucking FTMs because they have a front hole".</p>

        <p>An important part of the embodiment of masculinity is the ability to sexually "penetrate" another person. As Rosario ([<a href="#ref47">47</a>] :186) has noted: "... penetrative performance [is] the ultimate masculine gender performative". Conversely, being penetrated involves a loss of masculinity (Wooden and Parker [<a href="#ref73">73</a>] ). Thus, for example, in Latin countries, it is common for men who have sex with men to be considered differently depending on whether they take "active" or "passive" roles in penetration (Carrier [<a href="#ref7">7</a>] ; Lancaster[<a href="#ref31">31</a>]; and for a more nuanced description of what is involved, see Carrillo and Fontdevila [<a href="#ref8">8</a>] ). The penetrator is said to not lose his "manhood" and to not be considered "homosexual" as is the penetrated (for the United States, see Wegesin and Meyer‐Bahlburg [<a href="#ref65">65</a>] ).</p>

        <p>Even though trans men are subject to such cultural beliefs, it is a more complex matter for them. First, in the past when living as women, some of them had had the experience of being sexually penetrated by a male. Second, many had been sexually penetrated by a female—for example, with a strap‐on dildo. Third, becoming a man could mean becoming a man who identified as "gay", "bisexual", or "queer", so that being sexually penetrated reinforced rather than diminished a sense of manhood.</p>

        <p>All but two of the trans men we interviewed had retained their vaginas, which could, thus, be used in sexual activity. Vaginal sex could create some ambivalence among gay trans men. Having a "front hole" did not necessarily mean that it was available for sexual activity. Lathe said he would dislike having his vagina penetrated, as "...being penetrated is an essentially female‐defining thing". He said that he might agree to be penetrated by the right person "...if I didn't feel like it somehow endangered my maleness". The complexity of sexualized embodiment as a trans man was further shown by Lathe's concern that his male partner feel he is with another man: "...I'm definitely worried that I don't want to be girly in anything I'm doing sexually". On the other hand, Steven (who defined as queer/pansexual), liked to be vaginally penetrated but also was concerned that his partner not see him as a woman and "...is not fucking me like [I'm] a woman". Other indications of ambivalence were Speed's fatalistic acceptance of vaginal penetration to please his partners although he himself appeared to distance himself from the experience. As he ruminated, "I have vaginal sex [with men]...um...but that's not really my genitalia [his emphasis]". But there were also those who had difficulty not seeing it as a trace phenomenon. Steven stated, "It reminds me of... the sex I had as a woman... [that is, it] can trigger some of the memories [of having sex as a woman]".</p>

        <p>We are not implying that trans men may not get sexual pleasure from vaginal penetration—only that it is difficult for some of them to align this sexualized embodiment with their masculine gendered embodiment. As Christian commented, "I like [vaginal sex] a lot because it adds to my sexual pleasure. I think a lot more trans men like it than acknowledge this. Bio‐men don't have vaginas to use...gee, too bad for them!"</p>

        <p><h2>Loosely Coupled Embodiments</h2></p>
        <p>Here we find the most variability in the connection between gendered and sexualized embodiments. Just as it is possible to embody gender in ways other than sexually, it is not necessarily the case that sexualized embodiment will always be seen by the acting party as connected to his gendered embodiment.[<a href="#ref5">5</a>] Here we consider what can often be involved in such cases of nonconnection—factors involving power and of identity and its embodiments.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Sexual Dominance</h3></p>
        <p>Most hegemonic conceptions of masculinity assume that to be a man is to be dominant over women. Such gendered embodiments fit well with sexualized embodiment where the male body is usually thought of as dominant, culturally prescribed through the "missionary position", with the man on top of the woman, favorably placed to penetrate her. One important task that trans men ask of their female partners is to take the role of the "girl" (i.e., be a bottom) to bolster their masculinity (cf. Ward [<a href="#ref63">63</a>] ).The position of the body during sex, then, can be an important part of sexualized masculine embodiment. Even bracketing gender, for example as among same‐sex couples, sexualized embodiment of power and control through penetration and bodily positioning can still be an issue. For trans persons, the gendered and sexualized embodiments may be even more loosely coupled.</p>

        <p>Throughout the interviews many of the trans men made reference to the positions they took during sexual interaction, with a large number talking about being "tops" or "bottoms". For some this reflected BDSM (bondage discipline sadomasochism) discourse and referred to the dominant and submissive roles that structure such play. Indeed, many of the trans men in the study were part of the SM scene popular in San Francisco (cf. Califia [<a href="#ref6">6</a>] ). Others were familiar with the terminology from the gay and lesbian subcultures where it referred to preferences for insertive or receptive sexual practices (Wegesin and Meyer‐Bahlburg [<a href="#ref65">65</a>] ). It might be expected that as their commitment to a masculine gender identity increased during transition they would acquire a greater interest in "topping". But this was not always the case. Rather, the connection between gendered and sexualized embodiment through sexual position turned out to be only loosely coupled. A number of factors were involved.</p>

        <p>First, there were those trans men who identified as queer—so that the gender binary and its associated gender roles did not necessarily provide the template for organizing their sexuality. Instead, their being a top or bottom seemed to have more to do with bodily pleasure. Kevin (who defined as queer) said that earlier in his transition he was a top when having sex with women (a leftover from his lesbian days). Now he said he was more comfortable being a bottom when having sex with men because he felt "it doesn't make me less of a man anymore". He also noted that his earlier role as a top was related to the lack of opportunities for sexual partners in the city where he was living when he began his transition. In San Francisco there were more men who were interested in "trans dudes" like himself, so he said he had become a "big old bottom". This illustrates, again, the role the locale can play in connecting the embodiments.</p>

        <p>Another factor in determining the meaning of dominance among the trans men was who their sex partners were, especially the partner's sexual‐preference identity. Tim (gay identified) preferred having sex with men who identified as tops—men who were "butches". His sexual fantasies were all about bottoming, being in a daddy–boy relationship, being submissive and receiving pain. For him, transition had involved becoming sexual with what he referred to as more "male‐identified men", especially gay men, and bottoming through receptive vaginal and anal intercourse and being vaginally fisted. Tim was adamant about the pleasure he received from being a bottom and that he was not concerned about gender validation through the role he played.</p>

        <p>Sex partners who had a strong desire for carrying out sex in a certain way could also interfere with the trans man's preferred role in sexual interaction. Thus, Speed commented that with straight genetic women "...if I'm perceived as masculine, then I'm expected to fulfill the dominant role...whether or not I owned it or identified as such."" Steven said, "I don't see topping or bottoming as a gender‐related thing... . My most important relationship was with a man—a D–S [dominant–submissive] relationship… . He needed reinforcement of his own power as a dominant."[<a href="#ref6">6</a>]</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Sexual Preference Identities</h3></p>
        <p>Changing one's body and gender identity could also lead to a change in the way trans men made sense of their sexuality. Our society's dominant sexual scripts have made the gender of the desired partner the most important feature of this identification (thus the traditional categories of "homosexual", "heterosexual", and "bisexual"). Some of the trans men used these traditional identities of sexual preference or their slang terms (thus, five said they were "heterosexual" or "straight", none said "homosexual" but four said "gay", and four said "bisexual"), but almost half (n = 11) defined their sexual preference as "queer" and one as "pansexual". The "queer" label emphasized the belief that bodies and genders do not necessarily fit in a conventional way and neither do gender and sexual preference.</p>

        <p>A loose coupling between gendered and sexualized embodiments that occurred through taking on a queer identity was therefore not uncommon. The vast majority of the study group said they had changed their sexual preference identity since transitioning. Most (n = 17) noted that they had sought a label that would fit their new gender identity (cf. Bockting [<a href="#ref2">2</a>] ). The most common change in identities was from lesbian/dyke to queer (n = 9). If we include "bisexual" with lesbian/dyke as an initial identity, the number who took on a queer identity increases to 11.[<a href="#ref7">7</a>]</p>

        <p>For example, Richard identified as queer and also as a "trans guy". In his words, "...at the end of the day, I knew I wasn't going to be happy in any sort of stereotyped gender, but...I'm much more comfortable with a wider spectrum of masculine things". Other trans men exemplified another characteristic of "queerness"—the looseness of the connection between their gender identity and their sexual preference. This was shown in the changes in their sexual preference identities (cf. Devor [<a href="#ref15">15</a>] ). These were not always easy to chart. Sometimes the trans men were unable to articulate a clear identity, sometimes they said they had gone through a series of such identities, and sometimes they referred to currently having more than one sexual preference identity. Thus, Steven exemplified multiple identities, identifying as a "gay man, queer, and pansexual". The complexity of such changes was illustrated by Nicholas who said, "When I was younger I thought I was straight... . Then I identified as a queer female. And then more like a dyke—and now just a trans person who feels queer overall". He goes on to say that he had "come full circle" in transitioning before he had the terminology to describe it. He knew he did not fit in the "binary system" (his words) and had tried out hypermasculinity and passing, but now accepted himself as "consistently gender fluid". He said he was sexually attracted to trans, gay, and straight men.</p>

        <p>Patrick identified as a butch lesbian before transitioning, but had trouble defining his sexuality before he discovered the queer label. He could not identify as straight with his girlfriend— "I'm queer because I can't wrap my head around it... . I can't identify with straight men". He said he would also like to have sex with men (as a man—which was another trans man theme). Going from dyke to queer, he observed, "I didn't get that there was this delineation; for some people queer means something that it doesn't mean to somebody else". Here, then, was a trans man who was looking for an identity, but had difficulty in finding one that fit. His sexual experiences did not seem as varied as in the previous cases, but rather were consistent with the type of female partners he had when identifying as a dyke.</p>

        <p>Amad, on the other hand, was involved with a variety of types of partners since transitioning—especially other trans persons. As he put it, "I was never into trans people before. I waited to come up with a term because I'm attracted to femme women and really attracted to trans men. And I like gay male attention—it affirms my gender—and, you know, that's cool". Later in the interview, he said, "I'm queer because suddenly I've opened to this world of trans people and gender‐queer people... . I even like people born male. So, yeah, I'd say I'm overboard queer".</p>

        <p>Finally, the queer and trans man identities received broad support in the San Francisco sexual underground. Again, we see the role of the social context highlighted as a factor shaping gendered and sexualized embodiment. Moreover, given that many of the study participants had moved to San Francisco after residing in other locales, they contrasted the availability of identities in San Francisco that were unavailable where they had previously resided—and how these novel identities meshed with their gendered and sexualized embodiments. One participant ruminated about leaving such a supportive community: "If I ever left San Francisco... am I still going to be a queer person or [just become] some...random dude?"</p>

        <p><h2>Summary And Conclusion</h2></p>
        <p>This research investigated how trans men in San Francisco were impacted by their embodied experiences of gender and sexuality. Specifically, we examined how they made an effort to embody a masculinity through reflexively tying it to their sexuality. Further, we looked at the degree to which these elements of embodiment were coupled, and how this connection was mediated and experienced through the geographical locale and historical situation in which they found themselves.</p>
        <p>The role of the body is evident in the most tightly coupled of the embodiments, where trans men were affected by taken‐for‐granted notions of the gender binary. Chief among these was removal of the breasts as signifiers of femaleness. The relative absence of a desire for genital modification in the study group reflected a generational change apparent among trans men. Thus, the tight coupling between gender and sexuality may be relaxing for some trans people, especially in the context of liberal locales like San Francisco. We should be aware, however, that many trans persons in other locales insist on the connection between their embodiments. For example, in more conservative locales they are more likely to reject the labels of "trans", "trans men", and "trans women", and describe themselves simply as "men" and "women" (Namaste [<a href="#ref34">34</a>] ; Prosser [<a href="#ref43">43</a>] ).</p>

        <p>The tightness between gendered and sexualized embodiments evident in the study group was vividly illustrated in their interpretations of how testosterone had affected their sexuality. Generally, they drew on cultural scenarios of male sexuality to account for the changes going on in their body. Increased "sex drive", the nature of their orgasms, and a desire for casual sex were seen as evidence of their burgeoning masculinity. This coupling was loosened among those trans men who did not accept such hegemonic views or had problems interpreting their body as fully male.</p>

        <p>The relationship between gender and sexuality was more loosely coupled in those instances where interpersonal scripts in terms of validation from a sex partner were involved. For example, their relationships with gay men could be ambivalent, sometimes experienced as confirming a masculine identity and sometimes not. Partner validation involved an acceptance of the trans man's body and a willingness to engage in sex in a gender confirming way. The issue of whether to allow vaginal penetration indicated a clear connection between gendered and sexualized embodiment. The experience of vaginal penetration could carry a cultural de‐masculinizing meaning, especially if accompanied by the trace phenomenon of remembered vaginal sexual experiences. Trans men could neutralize this by reinterpreting their vagina as a nonfemale part and/or accepting what they felt was a gay male meaning to penetration.</p>

        <p>The question of loosely coupled embodiments could especially be an issue for trans people who live in a hostile or nonsupportive environment. Here they face discrimination (cf. Schilt [<a href="#ref50">50</a>] ), are often isolated, and have little opportunity to form sexual relationships, thus lacking the opportunity to explore the connection between their gendered and sexualized embodiments. On the other hand, San Francisco provides a variety of discourses (notable queer theories and ideologies) that decouple gender and sexuality and destabilize naturalizing connotations. This allows for vagueness and fluidity in the construction of what it means to be a man or woman (or even the wholesale rejection of these categories), which can also make the issue of what sexuality and sexual preference identity to adopt equally inventive. It is our contention that the label "queer" often operates as a default category here, making sense of a bewildering variety of combinations.</p>

        <p>Loosely coupled embodiment is also seen in the question of dominance and submission—ingredients of traditional gender. Here, the body is eroticized through the bodily positions taken, commonly referred to as "topping" and "bottoming". There is also a trace element to this in that topping and bottoming are familiar terms in the lesbian community from which many of the participating trans men come. Thus, there is often a mix between old and new gender meanings, sexual preference identities, and sexualities (with many of the study participants familiar with BDSM practices where top and bottom can have a different meaning). It seems clear, then, that the relationship between gender and sexuality can be fruitfully explored by looking at the reported lived experience of trans persons. When the focus shifts to how their embodiment shapes this connection, new insights can be produced, especially at what Jackson ([<a href="#ref27">27</a>] ) refers to as the level of subjectivity. Throughout the research, the San Francisco trans men exhibited considerable agency as they attempted to align together their notions of body, gender, sexuality, and sexual preference identity. The constant reflexivity involved throws considerable light on the processes of both "doing gender" and "doing sexuality", which should be of prime interest to sociology (Plummer [<a href="#ref42">42</a>] ; West and Zimmerman [<a href="#ref70">70</a>] ).</p>

        <p>At the same time, we should acknowledge the "continued uncertainty" (cf. Lev [<a href="#ref33">33</a>] ; Weinberg et al. [<a href="#ref67">67</a>] ) many trans men experience, and/or the irrelevance of moving to these conventional identities. Both of these possibilities are highly dependent on individual trajectories and these, in turn, can be similarly dependent on the social context—that is, the locale in which they are situated. One result found within the study group was that as persons got older uncertainty decreased, as less emphasis was put on trying to live up to a more stereotyped masculinity (cf. Dozier [<a href="#ref17">17</a>] ) as more nuanced and varied notions of sex and gender were encountered.</p>

        <p>We have especially emphasized the importance of sexual preference identity in the study of the trans phenomena. It makes a great deal of difference for these San Francisco trans men whether they see themselves as queer, gay, straight or bisexual men. The mutual constitution of gender and sexuality is differently coupled with each sexual preference identity. Straight trans men have the advantage of occupying more of a conventional role while gay trans men are doubly stigmatized as both trans and gay. How each sexual preference identity acts to confirm gender needs further study. As we noted earlier, if trans men are experimenting with different gender configurations, it is no surprise that so many of them adopted the sexual preference identity of "queer", which provided the loosest connection between gendered and sexualized embodiment that was available—and thus contributed to the ease of transitioning.</p>

        <p>We do not assume that we have captured all the factors at play in shaping the study group's subjectivity, as our emphasis has been on those mediated through the sexualized body. We certainly do not mean to say that that is all there is to trans subjectivity. The transcripts reflect many other issues, especially those concerning discrimination (cf. Schilt [<a href="#ref50">50</a>] ) as well as the trans man's day‐to‐day routines—seeing friends, going on vacation, and so forth (cf. Pfeffer [<a href="#ref39">39</a>] ). The focus on sexuality was simply a theoretician's choice and we do not intend to "oversexualize trans people" or imply that sex is all there is to their lives (cf. Hines [<a href="#ref24">24</a>] ). In this regard, there are many intersectional factors we could not or did not deal with; for example, we did not have enough persons with little education to include the intersection with educational status in the analysis. Similarly, we were not able to analyze the data by age, which is of great importance, not only because it produces generational differences among trans men, but also directly impacts where they may be in their transition. We are also aware that trans phenomena go beyond San Francisco and are worldwide and that we and the study participants reflect a bias. Because of the tremendous diversity of trans men, then, these results should not be generalized beyond the study group. Rather we believe they represent the kind of qualitative work needed for the exploration of the nature and development of trans sexuality (Bockting, Benner, and Coleman [<a href="#ref3">3</a>] ).</p>

        <p>Finally, we acknowledge the increasing role the body plays in contemporary sociological and sexological theory. The notion of embodiment, especially as reflected through "body techniques" (Crossley [<a href="#ref13">13</a>] ), not only provides a link between gender and sexuality, but also underscores the subjectivities and identities involved. What we offer in this research is the application of this perspective to trans experiences through the vivid illustration of the process of "reflexive embodiment" (Crossley [<a href="#ref12">12</a>] ; Waskul and Vannini [<a href="#ref64">64</a>] )—a concept that has become a mainstay of interactionist theories of sexuality (cf. Rahman and Jackson [<a href="#ref44">44</a>] ).</p>
