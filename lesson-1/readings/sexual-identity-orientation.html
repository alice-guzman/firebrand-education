        <p>Despite a rich theory base about ways to define and understand sexual orientation and sexual identity, there is little consensus about these. This may well be due to the significant and unresolved problems in how one measures sexual orientations; likely gender differences in the nature of sexuality, especially the degree of sexual fluidity; and the possibility of considerable variance within categories of bisexuality, homosexuality, and heterosexuality. Such theories have long split along biological (essentialist) and environmental (social constructionist) lines. The best current estimate is that sexual orientations are more complex that has previously been recognized, with both biological and social components, but with likely gender variation of the relative degrees of contributions from these broad components.</p>

        <p><h2>Defining sexual orientation</h2></p>

        <p>Conceptualization and measurement of sexual orientation is relatively new, beginning only over a century ago (<a href="#halwani">Halwani 1998</a>). It is important to clarify what sexual orientation does and does not entail. <a href="#shively">Shively and De Cecco's (1977)</a> division of human sexuality into four components provides a useful paradigm. The first component is biological sex, the genetic material encoded in chromosomes. The second is gender identity, the subjective sense of being male or female. The third is social sex role, the degree of fit with prescribed behaviors and mores considered appropriate for males and females in a given culture. The last component, sexual orientation, is sexual desire and/or affectional disposition of the individual toward others of the same and/or different sex. Human sexuality involves all these separate components, but one component does not necessarily predict any other. This entry will concentrate only on the sexual orientation component—usually heterosexuality, bisexuality, or homosexuality, but also other, more complex permutations. It is important to note that individuals may not identify with any particular label while still having behaviors and desires usually associated with the label.</p>

        <p><h2>Does sexual orientation exist?</h2></p>
        <p>An assumption embedded in defining sexual orientation is that, however one categorizes it, such categories are "real": that they exist. Sometimes additional assumptions are made that these categories (e.g., heterosexual, bisexual, homosexual) are intrinsic and even immutable. Recent decades have seen ongoing controversy about whether these categories truly exist (the "essentialist" view) or whether they are much more fluid or may not exist at all, except as a cultural fabrication or construct (the "social constructionist" view). Current views of sexual orientation call for a more nuanced understanding than purely essentialist or constructionist approaches offer. Yet studying human sexuality requires some use of categorial language; to discuss and research sexual orientation requires use of categories, if only as a heuristic device.</p>

        <p><h2>Models of sexual and relational orientation</h2></p>

        <p>Sexual orientation has been conceptualized in a number of ways over the past few decades. <a href="#moe">Moe et al. (2011)</a> summarized such models as including the heterosexual–homosexual dichotomy model, the Kinsey scale, the biological–essentialist model, the social constructionist model, lesbian and gay identity development, two‐dimensional models that include sexual orientation and relational orientation, the sexual life course development model, and the multiple continua model.</p>

        <p>All of these models have shortcomings, some severely so. <a href="#moe">Moe et al. (2011)</a> can be consulted for details, but empirical support for such models is often thin, sometimes nonexistent, and in some cases the model contradicts available research. Many models are incomplete in the factors and contexts considered; they exclude those with certain expressions of sexualities. The models generally look at sexual orientation in isolation from other psychological and cultural experiences in which individuals are embedded. They have value as an impetus to theory and research, but many limitations.</p>

        <p><h2>What is being measured in definitions of sexual orientation?</h2></p>

        <p>These models are unsatisfying because of an overreaching, ad hoc quality they often share, but there is a more fundamental and often unarticulated problem underlying them: What precisely is being measured or counted when one defines sexual orientations? Does one count sexual behavior, erotic fantasy, or both? If both, how are they weighted? Should affectional orientation (one's orientation to the same or different sex for emotional and intimate needs) be a third variable? How is that weighted? How does one conceptualize individuals in whom these three variables are inconsistent? For example, is a man whose sexual behavior and sexual fantasy predominantly involve other males, and whose closest intimate relationships are also with males, the “same” in orientation as a man with the same behavior and fantasy pattern, but whose close intimate relationships are with women? One can easily imagine that these three variables can operate independently across individuals, but it is not clear how one "names" such variation.</p>

        <p>Another wrinkle is the strength of any of these variables across the same or different sexes. For example, consider a person who has a high degree of interest in the same sex and an equally high degree of interest in the opposite sex. Then consider a person who has a minimal degree of interest in both the same and the opposite sex. In the Kinsey scale model, both individuals would be rated a 3 (bisexual), because their same and opposite sex interests are equal. But these individuals clearly have very different experiences of sexuality. In other words, the Kinsey scale covertly assumes that same‐sex and opposite‐sex interests are at the expense of each other. What if they operate independently, as <a href="#shively">Shively and De Cecco (1977)</a> suggested? This solution likely better reflects the complexity of sexual orientation. But how does one categorize individuals when there are three variables (behavior, fantasy, affectional orientation), each of which is described by the two components of same‐sex and opposite‐sex interest, which in turn operate independently of each other?</p>

        <p>The complexities do not end there. As some of the models above describe, when one assesses these variables in an individual is crucial. Many nonheterosexual people may well go through stages of identity and life course development during which their self‐perceptions evolve; this is especially true for adolescents and young adults. Self‐perception may also be influenced by gender, women generally describing themselves as more fluid than men.</p>

        <p>Since nonheterosexual individuals often remain the target of harassment and ostracism, there is also the very real problem of whether nonheterosexual persons will accurately disclose their orientations, however they might conceptualize them, to a researcher. In other words, disclosure of nonheterosexual orientations occurs in a sociopolitical context that frequently shapes and possibly alters that disclosure. Further, most commonly used terms—such as "straight", "bi", "gay/lesbian", or "queer"—are wildly imprecise, in that individuals can use them to describe any in a broad array of behavioral, affectional, identity, fantasy, political, and other variables; these and similar words do not mean the same from one person to another.</p>

        <p>Finally, as the entry on "sexual fluidity" details, some individuals (and generally more women than men) experience sexual attraction and subsequent behaviors as situationally dependent and variable over the life span. This is to be differentiated from bisexuality, which is generally a pattern of sexual attraction toward both same‐sex and opposite‐sex partners that is consistent and stable over time; sexually fluid individuals do not experience that stable pattern (<a href="#diamond">Diamond 2008</a>). A number of hypotheses can be generated from this intriguing line of work. First, there may well be some individuals, and it would appear that these are likely more often women than men, whose sexual orientation is fluid—while for others it is more stable. Second, it may be the case that the nature of sexual orientation differs between men and women, and/or that more variations within each sexual orientation than are currently conceptualized are mediated in part by gender.</p>

        <p>Readers interested in the complexities of these issues can consult <a href="#gonsiorek1991">Gonsiorek and Weinrich (1991)</a>, <a href="#gonsiorek1995">Gonsiorek, Sell, and Weinrich (1995)</a>, and <a href="#sell1997">Sell (1997)</a>. These issues are crucial because, if there is to be any thorough study of sexual orientation, there must be precision about the groups being studied.</p>

        <p><h2>Cross‐cultural and historical challenges to categorical approach</h2></p>

        <p>Historical accounts of sexual behavior and identities in nonindustrial Euro‐American cultures are often not congruent with a bimodal or trimodal system of sexual orientation and may support a constructionist point of view. In particular, there are two types of same‐sex behavior that are typically considered part of the dominant normative behavior of the culture in which they are found: age‐structured same‐sex behavior and gender‐defined same‐sex behavior (<a href="#dykes1999">Dykes 1999</a>). Also the type of sexual practice performed can determine whether an individual is considered part of the dominant normative sexual orientation. These variations in understanding sexual orientation highlight the contextual and environmental factors involved in sexual orientation.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Age-structured same-sex behavior</h3></p>
        <p>In ancient Greece a form of same‐sex behavior between older males and younger boys was at times idealized. This age‐graded sexual behavior was rule‐bound and not necessarily about desire but about socialization and the education of young boys to masculine gender roles, politics, and the military (<a href="#armstrong2005">Armstrong‐Percy III 2005</a>). A similar age‐graded form of same‐sex behavior has occurred until relatively recently in different cultures, such as the Sambia of Papua, New Guinea and the Azande of Sudan.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Gender-defined same-sex behavior</h3></p>

        <p>In many Native American cultures a form of gender‐defined same‐sex behavior exists (<a href="#balestrery">Balestrery 2012</a>); it is generally displayed by individuals who are gender neutral or effeminate males. Such individuals hold a strong cultural role, which is often considered sacred.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Position or role in same-sex behavior</h3></p>

        <p>In some Latin American, Middle Eastern, and Asian cultures same‐sex behavior is considered normative and part of the dominant sexual culture, depending on the behaviors or roles the individual engages in (<a href="#cardoso2009">Cardoso 2009</a>). Males who participate in same‐sex insertive or active behavior are not considered part of a sexual minority group by their culture (<a href="#cardoso2009">Cardoso 2009</a>). Their receptive counterparts are considered part of a sexual minority group.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">A framework for understanding different expressions in sexual orientation</h3></p>

        <p>These historical and cultural differences highlight a social constructionist point of view: human sexuality is contextually bound with developmental, interpersonal, experiential, and cultural influences creating unique understandings of sexuality (<a href="#stein1997">Stein 1997</a>), which are encoded and reified in language. Such linguistic labels mirror existing cultural values and allow for an identity to develop. Queer theorists take the constructionists’ claim a step further, asserting that sexual orientation categories were created in order to exert power over minority groups (<a href="#balestrery">Balestrery 2012</a>; <a href="#haperin2003">Halperin 2003</a>). Queer theorists seek to deconstruct the labels and language of the dominant sexual majority, thus allowing for an expression of sexual orientation that is nonrestrictive and mirrors the true multiplicity of human sexual orientation (<a href="#dykes1999">Dykes 1999</a>; <a href="#halperin2003">Halperin 2003</a>; <a href="halwani">Halwani 1998</a>).</p>

        <p>On the other hand, social constructionists and queer theorists may be oversimplifying the historical record. While there is little doubt that understandings of sexuality are rooted in time and place, the premodern fluidity asserted by these theorists may be overstated. Aristophanes’ famous speech in Plato's Symposium, in which different sexual interests are explained through the metaphor of individuals having been severed from their literal other half, which could have been of the same or of the opposite sex, suggests that a notion of stability in same‐sex and opposite‐sex interests existed in the observations of some commentators in the classical Greek world. <a href="#boswell1994">Boswell (1994)</a> amply documented the existence of same‐sex marriage rituals in Christian communities in premodern Europe, which suggests a perception in those communities that sexual interests are sufficiently stable to warrant marital commitment. <a href="#courove1985">Courouve's (1985)</a> presentation of terms used in the French language in recent centuries to describe male homosexuality is intriguing in that it suggests gradations of categories that are different from modern conceptualizations, but multiple categories nonetheless.</p>

        <p>Ultimately there is inherent paradox in the social constructionist/queer theory positions, in that they assert that the late twentieth‐century European/North American political–philosophical critique they offer about how sexual categories function must universally apply to all cultures and at all historical times; other ways of understanding are not even considered valid.</p>

        <p><h2>In support of a modified essentialist viewpoint</h2></p>

        <p>While there are strong reasons to believe that a purely essentialist categorial model of sexual orientation is limiting and culture‐bound, there is also strong evidence that supports a clear difference between individuals from different orientation categories. This evidence looks at observable differences between groups, familial prevalence, and possible biological etiologies.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Observable differences between individuals in different orientation groups</h3></p>

        <p>Some of the most concrete evidence highlighting essential differences between orientation groups is provided by anatomical and physiological data. Conclusive evidence has been found documenting external physical differences, brain anatomy differences, and neural circuitry differences between orientation groups.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Familial differences</h3></p>

        <p>Research from family proband studies, twin studies, and adoption studies supports the idea of some degree of heritability of sexual orientations. The heritability of homosexuality appears to be more prevalent in males than in females, suggesting different etiologies for males and females (<a href="#bailey2000">Bailey et al. 2000</a>). The heritability of male homosexuality is estimated to fall in the range of 0.27 to 0.76; one study found that homosexual males were four times more likely than homosexual females to have a homosexual brother (<a href="#jenkins2010">Jenkins 2010</a>).</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Possible biological factors in sexual orientation development</h3></p>

        <p>Differences in anatomy and physiology, along with heritability rates, suggest that biology plays a strong role in sexual orientation, particularly in males. Two pathways suggested are (1) the genetic link; and (2) the neurohomonal/prenatal developmental model of sexual orientation. </p>

        <p>Attempts to find a "gay gene" have proven difficult so far; inheritance of homosexuality is currently believed to be due to many genes rather than to a singular one, and several markers have been identified (<a href="jenkins2010">Jenkins 2010</a>). Prenatal development is also believed to affect the sexual orientation of an individual. Retrospective studies investigating human maternal stress have shown mixed results in stress‐level differences of mothers with heterosexual or homosexual sons (Jenkins 2010), suggesting that the development of sexual orientation is due to many factors. An epigenetic model, where a biological tendency is inherited but expression of the underlying phenotype is activated by an individual's experiences and environment, best fits the reality of environmental and biological data.</p>

        <p><h2>Final thoughts</h2></p>

        <p>A significant complication in understanding the sexual orientations, however one conceptualizes them, is brought by the fact that we may be "cutting the pie" in an inaccurate way with current understandings. If there are variants of homosexualities, bisexualities, and heterosexualities that are as different within groups as they are between groups, it may not be surprising that the research is so unsettled—since, if that is the case, heterogeneous groups are thrown together as if they were homogenous. In this sense, if measurable biological markers for aspects of sexual orientations become reliably established, that would certainly ease these considerable definitional and measurement dilemmas, though it would be unlikely to eliminate them.</p>
