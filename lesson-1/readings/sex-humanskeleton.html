        <p>The responsive nature of bone to internal programming by growth and sex hormones, as well as to functional pressures from outside of the body, provides a number of clues as to how to use bone to assess a wide variety of indicators of identity. Here an overview of the human skeleton as a sexually dimorphic biological tissue is provided. A summary of techniques used to estimate biological sex from human remains in both forensic and archaeological contexts is offered. Current issues in the fomentation of methods are discussed. Theoretical and methodological issues in the development and application of sex determination methods are reviewed. Finally, an overview of the ways in which skeletal sex estimation has been important to recent social science research is presented.</p>

        <p>Skeletal material is among the most plastic and flexible of all human tissues. Its unique inorganic (mostly calcium phosphate salts) and organic (collagen) structure provides strength, but also the ability to withstand enormous compressive, tensile, twisting, and shearing pressures without breaking. Bone is also in a constant state of remodeling: old, structurally fatigued bone is resorbed and new, structurally sound bone is formed. The formation of bone exceeds the resorption of bone during periods of growth and development, and thus there is a steady gain in three‐dimensional bone growth, from the tiny toothpick‐size bones we have at birth to the fully formed structures we attain in adulthood.</p>

        <p>The responsive nature of bone to internal programming by growth and sex hormones, as well as to functional pressures from outside of the body, provides a number of clues to how to use it in order to assess a wide variety of indicators of identity. In addition to sex, the other things that can be "read" from a skeleton are age at death, stature, ancestry, degree of muscularity, and, in some cases, disease and nutritional state. Because bone is responding on a daily basis to the stresses and strains of the 600‐plus muscles that interface with it, it records in decipherable ways the habitual behaviors of individuals prior to their death.</p>

        <p><h2>Sexual dimorphism</h2></p>

        <p>The evolution of the human species has followed a trajectory laden with selective pressures that originated in both the natural and the social environment. From our last common ancestor onward, primates (which include humans) have maintained sexual dimorphism—that is, physical differences in size and overall morphology between males and females. This feature is not unique to humans, however: many species’ skeletons exhibit sexual dimorphism. Among primates, however, humans have evolved to be moderately sexually dimorphic, while nonhuman primates such as chimpanzees, gorillas, and baboons typically present greater differences in body size between the sexes. The physical representation of this dimorphism includes both soft and hard tissues of primate anatomy. It is because of differences in hard tissue—that is, bones and teeth—that sex can be determined through examination of the skeleton.</p>

        <p>Dimorphism between human males and females reflects differential anatomical responses to bodily function and adaptive behaviors both at the individual level and as a species. Many of these adaptations are related to reproduction and the propagation of the species. Both morphological and behavioral changes were positively selected to improve reproductive fitness in a changing physical environment, and sexual dimorphism was a result.</p>

        <p>The skeletal system is directly impacted by, and thereby reflects, sexual differences. The differences between sexes can be generalized: male bones will be larger and more robust in morphology, while female bones will be smaller and more gracile in morphology. The distribution of these differences varies across the skeleton, and populations will exhibit variation as well. Bone growth and development over the life course is partly controlled by hormones such as testosterone, estrogen, and the human growth hormone. Thus sex differences in the skeleton are intricately linked to hormonal activity in the body; therefore most skeletal sex differences are not observable until after puberty. For this reason, sex estimation among children is incredibly difficult to make and, with the exception of DNA analysis, no subadult sexing technique has proven to be both replicable and reliable. Assuming normal hormonal and genetic function, the adult skeleton should reflect the appropriate respective sexual morphology.</p>

        <p><h2>Sexual differentiation of the human skeleton</h2></p>

        <p>Following skeletal growth maturation, sexual differences are most observable on the bones of the cranium and pelvis. These two areas of the skeleton have evolved to achieve sex‐specific functionality. Males have grown large, robust crania with more developed muscle attachment sites; this is often proposed to demonstrate physical superiority and fitness in mate competition with other males (see, however, <a href="#lovejoy2009">Lovejoy 2009</a>). Females have developed smaller, more gracile crania because they were not involved in such competition throughout human evolution. Within the pelvis, however, females demonstrate adaptive features that accommodate for the birthing of large‐brained offspring. Male pelves differ because they have no such physiological function.</p>

        <p>Features of the cranium that are most reliable in sex estimation include areas around the eyes, ears, neck, and chin. Again, the larger and more robust features are indicative of male sex, while the smaller and less developed features are indicative of female sex. Most features are scored by osteologists on an ordinal scale, where features are evaluated visually and manually. Around the eye, the upper orbit margin can be assessed as thick and dull (male) or as thin and sharp (female). Also in this region of the cranium, the brow ridges and the area between them can be observed to be large and projecting (male) or small and flat (female). Located just behind the ear, a projecting area of bone known as the mastoid process demonstrates sex via its overall size and volume. While the mastoid is variable between populations, a small mastoid process is generally estimated as female, while a large one is estimated as male. In the area of neck muscle attachment on the back of the cranium, the amount of rugosity is indicative of the individual's sex. More projection and roughness among the muscle attachment sites (known as nuchal lines or crests) is less defined and associated with males; smooth muscle attachment sites are associated with females. A more robust and developed chin area on the mandible is indicative of male sex, while a smooth and less developed chin area is indicative of female sex. Lastly, the cranium can be assessed for sex as a whole. Heavier overall weight and large, projecting features can be included in observations to assist in sex determination, particularly when the scores of individual features contradict each other or fall in the middle ("indeterminate") range. The relative dimorphism—and thereby accuracy—of various morphological features found throughout the human skull has been recently summarized in <a href="#rogers2005">Rogers (2005)</a> and in <a href="#williams2006">Williams and Rogers (2006)</a>.</p>

        <p>Features of the pelvis that reflect sexual differences are primarily related to facilitating birth in females. Bipedal locomotion in humans has forced the pelvic girdle, including the os coxae (hip bone: the innominate) and the sacrum, to have a flared and bowl shape. The evolution of large‐brained infants, coupled with this bipedal locomotion, resulted in a compromise between the shape of the pelvic bones and the manipulation of the infant body through the birth canal. Female pelves will therefore have wider features along the inferior side, so that an infant is not obstructed during birth. The greater sciatic notch near the hip joint is widest among females and somewhat narrow among males. Like cranial features, the greater sciatic notch is given a score of one (wide = female) to five (narrow = male). The pubic bones (ventral and anterior) of the os coxae mirror each other at the front of the pelvis and have shape differences that can inform sex. Again, to allow for greater space during birth, female pubic bones will have a rectangular shape, while male pubic ones will be more triangular. The joint where these two bones meet creates an angle that is obtuse in females and acute in males. Lastly, the curvature of the sacrum (the "tail bone") is different between the sexes. Male sacra are more curved toward the end, while female sacra are flatter, to accommodate space for infant movement during birth. A summary of pelvic morphology and its accuracy in sex estimation can be found in <a href="#rogers1994">Rogers and Saunders (1994)</a>.</p>

        <p>Other skeletal features that can be used to determine sex are less reliable than those described for the cranium and the pelvis. When used in conjunction with those features, however, they can be helpful. For example, long bones can be measured for length, head diameter, and width; and these metrics can be compared against known sample populations. Some nonmetric features are sex‐related, and their presence or absence can suggest one sex or the other. Although some research suggested that lesions and pits near the pubic symphysis in females were an indicator of pregnancy, <a href="#snodgrass">Snodgrass and Galloway (2003)</a> reported that the accuracy was not significant enough for this feature to be utilized. <a href="#komar2008">Komar and Buikstra (2008)</a> provide an excellent summary and critique of many of these methods. Because methodological and statistical approaches vary widely in this area, the reader is referred to these references and the further reading list presented at the end of this entry.</p>

        <p><h2>Recent research on skeletal sex estimation</h2></p>
        <p>Biological anthropologists are continually testing and challenging methodologies for sex estimation of skeletal elements, as they strive to achieve better accuracy and reliability. A sampling of research in the area of sex estimation between 2008 and 2012 revealed that much research is devoted to retesting older methods on new populations and attempting to create new discriminant functions using metric analysis. Statistical analysis using skeletal metrics has become a common method to assess dimorphism in the human skeleton (see <a href="#milner2012">Milner and Boldsen 2012</a> for an overview). Future research will no doubt continue this trend, as new and more reliable methods are explored.</p>

        <p>Research on sex estimation has also emphasized the need for minimal interobserver error. Where possible, methods should be replicable and quantifiable, for use in forensic contexts. To address these concerns, scholars have begun to apply new technology, such as 3D laser scans, to better assess features that historically required only visual assessment. These techniques hold much promise, as they have the potential to minimize errors in evaluation and may identify additional areas of sexual dimorphism in both adult and juvenile remains.</p>

        <p>Biochemical analyses in skeletal biology hold great potential for future estimations of sex. The use of ancient DNA provides opportunities to determine the sex of highly incomplete remains, and also of children's remains (see <a href="#kaestle2002">Kaestle and Horsburgh 2002</a> for a review). Additionally, these techniques may provide the opportunity to identify variations in chromosomal sex known as intersex conditions or disorders of sexual development.</p>

        <p><h2>Challenges in sex estimation when doing osteological analysis</h2></p>
        <p>The accuracy of sex determination is dependent on the completeness of the skeleton and on whether the individual has reached sexual maturity at the time of death. Attempting to assign sex to a prepubescent skeleton has yet to be perfected, although new techniques using DNA analysis of bone tissue have proven very accurate. The sex determination of adults is more straightforward and less problematic, as long as the skeleton is complete. If skeletal remains are fragmentary, incomplete, or poorly preserved, sexing is much more difficult. The most important bones for sexing are the cranium, the pelvis, and the femur; if these bones are not present, sex assignment will be more difficult.</p>

        <p><a href="#weiss1972">Weiss (1972)</a> presented a meta‐analysis of 43 studies of skeletal populations from various parts of the world, tabulating the percentage of these populations estimated to be males. After adjustments were made for cultural practices that could have influenced the sex ratio, he found that approximately 56 percent of the individuals from the 43 study populations were assigned the characteristics of males. Weiss concluded that there is a small but systematic bias of researchers in the assignment of male characteristics. This is because sex estimation relies on the identification of robust (i.e., male) features. Individuals exhibiting only slightly robust features may appear to be female, especially after adolescence. Because of this, Weiss and others have cautioned scholars to consider overall population dimorphism and the age of an individual when estimating. Additionally, this research makes clear that the overall size of bones should not be used as a sexing criterion.</p>

        <p>Beyond methodological concerns, skeletal biologists have become increasingly aware of the problems with the two‐sex model that underlies osteological analysis (see, for example, <a href="#geller2005">Geller 2005</a>). Scholars estimate that somewhere between 1 in 1,500 and 1 in 2,000 births are of children whose chromosomal or phenotypic sex differs from both male and female sex categories. Since the 1990s, it has become clear that a range of genetic and developmental alternatives challenge simple understandings of biological sex and of their phenotypic expression throughout the body (<a href="#fausto2000">Fausto‐Sterling 2000</a>; <a href="#rosario2009">Rosario 2009</a>). In contemporary populations, these conditions impact the skeleton and require consideration from biological anthropologists. Turner's syndrome, for example, leaves skeletons over one foot shorter than those of individuals with typical secondary sex characteristics (<a href="#sax2002">Sax 2002</a>). Other features are scoliosis and disruptions in the separation of the vertebrae in the lower back. Recently, scholars have called for archaeologists to consider this variability when examining human remains (<a href="#geller2009">Geller 2009</a>; <a href="joyce2008">Joyce 2008</a>). Ancient DNA studies may have the potential to identify many of the conditions that result in bodies that vary from both genetic and phenotypic definitions of sex. Such studies have the potential to refine the accuracy of sex estimations and to assist in understanding biological variation and its social meaning throughout antiquity.</p>

        <p><h2>Interpreting the sexed skeleton</h2></p>

        <p>Skeletal tissue represents unswerving confirmation of the biohistory of past populations. With some certainty, if the skeletal remains represent major elements of the body (head, arms, pelvis, spine, legs), bioarchaeologists can reconstruct not only the sex of an individual but also the age at death, standing height, level of muscularity, and a range of pathologies and ailments, including trauma as well as other data (<a href="#larsen1997">Larsen 1997</a>). This allows anthropologists to reconstruct the differential treatment and experiences of subgroups of people in the past. Sex differences in labor, in patterns of violence and inequality, in patterns of mortality and morbidity, as well as other differences have all been made between groups of burials from across various cultures and time periods (recently reviewed in <a href="#hollimon2011">Hollimon 2011</a>).</p>

        <p>Contextual analyses of skeletal populations have increasingly used multiple lines of data to reconstruct the differential treatment of the sexes in much more nuanced ways than those carried out by earlier osteologists. The use of multiple lines of skeletal, archaeological, and cultural data has enabled scholars to identify evidence of domestic violence, of the capture and enslavement of women, and of individuals who lived as third‐gender persons. Such scholarship relies entirely on the plasticity of the human skeleton, which is shaped by, and thereby reflective of, multiple aspects of an individual's social and biological identity. In this way human skeletal material provides scholars interested in sex and gender with a large body of data through which it becomes possible to generate hypotheses for evaluations that draw together the mutual influences between culture and human biology.</p>
