        <p>Conversation analysis (CA) facilitates examination of how sexuality is constructed in and through talk‐in‐interaction. Using recorded naturalistic data and drawing on a set of technical specifications of interactional phenomena, CA looks at when (and how) sexuality is relevant in talk. Examples are given of CA studies that look at coming out, heteronormativity, and category membership.</p>

        <p>Consideration of how sexuality is constructed in and through talk‐in‐interaction is a relatively new field, spanning little more than a decade. Early work on language and sexuality aimed to link sexual identities to language styles, for example "lesbians’ speech" (<a href="#moonwomon">Moonwomon‐Baird 1997</a>) or "gay men's English" (<a href="#leap1996">Leap 1996</a>). This work was widely criticized in the late 1990s and early 2000s as essentializing sexuality (in the same way in which gender was essentialized in studies of men's and women's speech styles). More recent work has focused on the socially constructed and performative nature of gender and sexuality in interaction: for overviews, see, for example, <a href="#cameron2003">Cameron and Kulick (2003</a>, <a href="#ref2006">2006</a>). The shift from studying lesbian/gay language to studying how sexuality is articulated or made manifest in social interaction has broadened the scope of the field beyond a focus on lesbian and gay sexualities, to include in particular the study of other marginalized sexualities (e.g., <a href="speer2007">Speer and Green 2007</a>) and the social construction of heterosexuality as normative (e.g., Kitzinger <a href="#ref2005a">2005a</a>, <a href="#ref2005b">2005b</a>).</p>

        <p><h2>Conversation analysis</h2></p>
        <p>Conversation analysis (CA) is the method par excellence for the study of talk‐in‐interaction. It was first developed by Harvey Sacks (see, for example, <a href="sacks1995">Sacks 1995</a>), in collaboration with Emanuel Schegloff and Gail Jefferson in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The intellectual roots of CA lie in the sociological tradition of ethnomethodology, which is concerned with social members’ ways of making sense of the everyday social world. For ethnomethodologists, social phenomena such as gender and sexuality are primarily accomplishments: created, sustained, and (sometimes) resisted through the practices of social members in interaction—practices that constitute and reproduce the social order. The analytic procedure of CA depends upon repeated inspection of (audio‐ or video‐) recorded naturalistic data, which are transcribed with the help of a notation (<a href="jefferson2004">Jefferson 2004</a>) that preserves the fine‐grained details of talk (e.g., pauses, inbreaths, sound stretches) that are demonstrably oriented to by conversational participants themselves. CA researchers collect data from ordinary everyday conversations, from general cultural and institutional contexts (e.g., radio and TV programs, medical consultations, classroom interactions), and from specialized contexts to which sexuality researchers have gained access (e.g., HIV/AIDS counseling, gay awareness training, LGBT helplines).</p>

        <p>Data analysis focuses upon the organized, recurrent, structural features of talk‐in‐interaction, which stand independently of the characteristics of particular speakers, including their sexuality. CA develops technical specifications of key interactional phenomena—such as sequence organization, turn taking, repair, word selection, action formation, and the overall structural organization of talk (<a href="scheloff2007">Schegloff 2007</a>:xiv)—thereby building a cumulative body of knowledge about the "building blocks" of social life. Reliance on—and contribution to—this body of knowledge is what most clearly differentiates CA from the (related) approaches of discourse analysis and discursive psychology.</p>

        <p><h2>Some key studies</h2></p>
        <p>Rather than studying how lesbians or gay men talk, CA research on sexuality addresses the much broader question “How (and when) is sexuality relevant in talk‐in‐interaction?” For example, <a href="kitzinger2000">Kitzinger (2000)</a> examined mundane, everyday "comings out"—as lesbian, gay, or bisexual, or as having had same‐sex sexual experiences—in relatively safe environments. Prompted by the observation that these comings out typically generate a bewildering absence of response, she drew on the CA domain of turn taking for an explanation. According to the classic turn‐taking model (<a href="sacks1974">Sacks, Schegloff, and Jefferson 1974</a>), the transition of speakership from one party to another becomes relevant at the possible completion of a unit of talk. Once a speaker has embarked upon a unit of talk, he or she is entitled to finish it before someone else has the right to start speaking—and this is so even if the unit of talk is a complex or lengthy one. Analyzing a corpus of actual recorded comings out (not reports of coming out), Kitzinger found that speakers typically embedded their comings out within a compound or extended unit of talk, such that, by the time they got to the end of unit, the opportunity for a response had passed. In effect, speakers can protect the coming out from being reacted to by buffering it with subsequent talk, slipping it into the conversation in a way that gets it heard, but protects both speaker and recipients from having to deal with it there and then.</p>

        <p>This work has been extended by <a href="land2005">Land and Kitzinger (2005)</a> and by <a href="liddicoat2009">Liddicoat (2009)</a>, who drew on the CA domain of repair and error correction. The term "repair" refers to practices for dealing with troubles in speaking, hearing, or understanding talk. Overt or "exposed" correction of an error in another person's talk is relatively rare in ordinary conversation—it suspends the ongoing business of the talk in order to do the correction, so it can sound hostile or aggressive. More common is what <a href="jefferson1987">Jefferson (1987)</a> calls "embedded" error correction: this allows the interactional business at hand to continue without disruption, because the correction takes place entirely within the context of that business at hand. Analyzing a corpus of telephone calls made to and from (self‐identified) lesbian households, <a href="land2005">Land and Kitzinger (2005)</a> found that (mundane) comings out were typically done as embedded corrections. For example, in a call made to register her partner, "Sandra", as a new patient to a dental practice, "Nicola" is asked by the receptionist: "What was his name?"" In responding to this question (which embodies an assumption of a male partner), Nicola could have said (something like) "No—my partner is female"; this would have been an exposed correction. What she actually says is: "It's Sandra Ferry". This embeds her correction of the receptionist's assumption within a fitted response to the question (and thereby it forwards the action of dental registration). Nicola's turn reveals her partner's gender, and thereby her own sexuality; but "coming out" is secondary to the main business of the interaction. <a href="liddicoat2009">Liddicoat's (2009)</a> data, drawn from Spanish language classes, show the same phenomenon. In an exchange between the teacher and a male student, "Sam", Sam also comes out as gay through an embedded correction. This coming out is made secondary to the business at hand of (correctly) answering the teacher's question, which is designed to test the students' ability to select appropriate adjective forms (i.e., masculine forms for masculine nouns, and feminine forms for feminine ones). The teacher asks Sam "Como es tu novia?" ("What's your girlfriend like?"). Sam replies "Mi novio es alto y delgado" ("My boyfriend is tall and slim"). He embeds the correction "boyfriend" into a fitted response to the teacher's question—and, in selecting masculine forms of the adjectives "tall" and "slim" (novio and delgado rather than the feminine forms novia and delgada) for a male person (his boyfriend), he also displays his competence in Spanish noun–adjective agreement. These mundane, ordinary comings out are quite unlike the dramatic announcements (heralded by "Mother, I have something to tell you") more commonly described in the literature.</p>

        <p>CA studies also contribute to the (relatively limited) literature on the social construction of heterosexuality: the pervasive, normative, often unexamined context for all non‐heterosexual sexualities. It can be difficult to interrogate heteronormativity precisely because it is so all‐pervasive; but CA provides some tools for doing so, particularly in the domains of word selection and person reference. In a review of the classic CA data sets, Kitzinger (<a href="2005b">2005b</a>) identified some key ways in which heterosexuality is routinely deployed as a taken‐for‐granted resource in ordinary everyday interaction. These interactional practices include heterosexual topic talk (e.g., about engagements, weddings, marital troubles, divorces) and person reference terms (e.g., "husband", "wife", and "in‐law" terminology)—the data were collected before marriage was available to same‐sex couples anywhere in the world. Typical practices also include identifying someone by reference to their spouse (e.g., "Mister Quinn's wife", "Mittie's husband"); the production of heterosexual couples (e.g., "Mary Carter and her boyfriend", "Bill and Gladys", "the Grahams"); and pronominal heterosexuality (the use of first‐person plural pronouns—we, us, our—often unexplicated, but routinely treated as referring to speaker and his or her spouse). In a parallel study, drawing on a corpus of out‐of‐hours calls to a doctor's office, Kitzinger (<a href="2005b">2005a</a>) showed how, in phoning to get medical help for a family member, callers routinely selected person reference terms drawn from the category set "family" (such as "husband" or "wife"). Analysis suggested that the selection of family terms was deployed to facilitate getting medical assistance for the person so referred to and to obviate the need for an account as to why it was the caller who was calling on behalf of that person—since a woman calling on behalf of her husband or a man calling on behalf of his wife is engaged in an activity culturally understood as normal: nothing special is happening in terms of the relationship displayed. This constitutes a mundane instance of heterosexual privilege accorded to those who take for granted, as others cannot, their access to a culture's family reference terms. Such terms are not available in any unproblematic way to non‐heterosexual couples.</p>

        <p>Finally, CA research on sexuality continually grapples with the question of "what counts" as "making sexuality (or gender) relevant" in talk‐in‐interaction: see <a href="#stokoe2002">Stokoe and Smithson (2002)</a> for a discussion of this issue. For some analysts only the explicit use of a categorical reference term (such as "gay man") will do; for others—because categories are "inference‐rich" (<a href="#sacks1995">Sacks 1995</a>)—reference to category‐bound activities (such as "hairdressing" or "interior design") can be sufficient. Relatively little work has examined more subtle and transient ways of invoking categorical memberships or individual attributes (see <a href="#wilkinson2003">Wilkinson and Kitzinger 2003</a> for an example). Also—as <a href="#schegloff1997">Schegloff (1997)</a> has emphasized—just the fact that someone is a member of a category (e.g., "lesbian") is not enough to justify referring to her as a lesbian—when she is also, for example, British, a professor, a Libran, and so on. There are always alternative forms of reference that are equally accurate; however, they are not, of course, all equally relevant on any given occasion. Sometimes a speaker may challenge the foregrounding of membership in one category by invoking an alternative category of which she is a member. So, in a discussion between (self‐identified) lesbians of the possible risk factors for breast cancer, one participant refers to herself as "a Lancashire lass" (Lancashire is a county in the north of England). She does this in order to question the category attributes (heavy drinking and smoking) applied to lesbians by pointing out that these attributes could also apply to people from Lancashire or from the north—and thereby to suggest that, if these risk factors are not specific to lesbians, then there is no reason to assume that lesbians are at particular risk for developing breast cancer (see Wilkinson and Kitzinger 2007). The key analytic task, then, is to specify, on any given occasion, the relevance of using a particular way of referring to someone: why that now?</p>
