        <p><h2>Abstract</h2></p>

        <p>Sexual communication, negotiation, and assertiveness comprise verbal and/or nonverbal interactions between individuals in a sexual or potentially sexual context. Direct forms of exchange tend to communicate one's interests or needs more effectively; indirect forms are more subtle and suggestive. Men and women are socialized differently in their use of these communication types, and interactions often take a somewhat scripted form, particularly in the heterosexual context.</p>

        <p>Sexual exchange, including communication, negotiation, and assertiveness, involves verbal and nonverbal interactions between sexual partners or potential sexual partners, either in person or through media or technology. For two people to engage each other in a sexual interaction, they must use one or more sensory modalities (visual, aural, olfactory, and/or tactile) and have the cognitive capacity required to intend and/or interpret the message exchanged as sexual. Early research on sexual exchange addressed sexual imagery in language and communication between marital partners. In the late 1960s and early 1970s research began to focus on partners' communication about contraception and problems in sexual functioning. The advent of the HIV epidemic in the 1980s led to a growth of research addressing how communication, negotiation, and assertiveness serve protective functions to help people avoid infection. Far fewer studies address sexual communication from a normative perspective, and most work focuses on individual communication patterns rather than on dyadic processes (<a href="#duck2007">Duck 2007</a>).</p>

        <p><h2>Communication</h2></p>
        <p>Sexual communication is the exchange of sexual information (e.g., ideas, emotions) with a partner through verbal or nonverbal forms of behavior or expression. Verbal forms may be direct (i.e., frank, clear, unambiguous) or, more commonly, indirect (e.g., through code words). Partners often develop an idiosyncratic terminology for private communications about sex, for instance terms for genitals and euphemisms for intercourse, a phenomenon that reflects some discomfort around frank sexual discourse. Nonverbal (nonlinguistic) sexual communication may involve facial expressions, touch, gestures, postures, gaze, distance, and paralanguage. Touch appears to be an especially important form of sexual communication and is used to convey emotion, sexual interest, and desire. Partners who touch more often report higher levels of sexual and relationship satisfaction.</p>

        <p>Researchers draw parallels with animal models and demonstrate that the nonverbal signs that humans share with other vertebrates are based on affiliative and submissive behaviors. </p>

        <p>Research on flirting scripts in heterosexual exchanges extends directly from studies of signaling among birds and primates. Studies indicate that women are more likely than men to communicate readiness for a sexual approach or advance. Signals used to convey sexual interest in a potential male partner include extended gaze, light touch, and preening. Men are often unaware that they have been signaled by a woman, but they are unlikely to be rebuffed if they make a subsequent sexual advance.</p>

        <p>Women may control these first expressions of sexual interest, but men tend to subsequently initiate sexual activity in more overt ways, typically first via indirect means of communication, then in more direct forms. Traditional socialization inhibits women, and also lesbian and bisexual women, from making overt sexual advances (<a href="#mccormick1994">)McCormick 1994</a>); they are socialized instead to control, limit, or reject (male) partners' sexual advances. Women may experience high levels of desire for varied sexual contact. However, they often risk strong social castigation for communicating high sexual interest. This discrepancy in societal evaluations of women and men is called the "sexual double standard." Some studies find support for a near-universal double standard, which permits men more freedom in sexual expression than women, whereas other research finds that permissive individuals generally are viewed more negatively than individuals who are more reserved with regard to sexual expression.</p>

        <p><h2>Negotiation between sexual partners</h2></p>

        <p>Negotiation refers to a form of communication between two or more partners that is intended to help them maximize one another's needs while reaching an agreement about one's roles and/or relationship parameters. Negotiation involves an exchange of information that is intended to produce some form of compromise or resolution. Successful negotiation requires effective communication skills, as these influence partners' ability to produce desired outcomes. Sexually distressed couples tend to show deficits in their ability to influence each other and to express themselves nonverbally.</p>

        <p>Sexual scripts refer to narrative sequences representing expected sexual interactions between partners. Tensions emerge when interests or preferences contradict or challenge these scripts, requiring partners to negotiate alternatives. Research on sexual negotiation has focused extensively on high‐risk scenarios, such as insisting on condom use during intercourse. A wide range of factors are associated with a reduced ability to negotiate effectively; such factors range from individual (e.g., negative mood, low self‐esteem, substance use) through dyadic (e.g., history of partner violence, length of relationship) and structural/contextual factors (e.g., lack of privacy, access to care). Effective negotiation is often determined more by partner and relationship characteristics than by specific strategies used.</p>

        <p>Girls and women tend to report greater difficulty in negotiating with sexual partners and higher rates of self‐silencing in negotiation (i.e., suppression of their interests or rights) than boys and men. An absence of explicit, verbally communicated negotiation undermines agency, that is, one's ability to influence a partner and to effect desired outcomes. Gender and power differentials between women and men also appear to be related to ability to negotiate one's interests or rights with a partner, girls and women often reporting lower levels than do boys and men.</p>

        <p><h2>Assertiveness in the sexual context</h2></p>

        <p>Sexual assertiveness refers to the clear and confident declaration of one's interests, rights, or point of view in a sexual context. This form of communication affirms both an individual's and his or her partner's position without aggression, anger, or other hostile expression. Assertiveness closely integrates related constructs, including decision making, refusal skills, and confidence. Sexual assertiveness enhances self‐esteem, body awareness, sexual response, and satisfaction. Women who are assertive in sexual contexts with male partners tend to endorse less traditional gender roles and report being in more established relationships. Men typically report high levels of compliance with requests that result from female sexual assertiveness.</p>
        <p>Girls and women report higher levels of partner pressure to engage in unwanted sexual activity and are more often the target of sexual harassment than boys and men, thus necessitating more use of sexual assertiveness. A wealth of research has shown that direct, unambiguous verbal strategies used early in an unwanted interaction prove most effective. Effective communication of sexual intentions and boundaries is a focus of many sex education programs offered to young people. These programs typically emphasize adopting clear and direct forms of verbal communication to express oneself in sexual contexts so as to avoid miscommunication and help ensure a partner's understanding and compliance.</p>
