        <p><strong>Keywords</strong>: <em>intimate life, teenage, premarital sexuality </em></p>

        <p><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2></p>

        <p><strong>Premarital sexuality</strong> became more and more accepted in occidental society, especially after the sixth decade of XX century, the sixties being considered "the sexual revolution" years. In our days, a serious relationship of love is nearly unimaginable without sex <sup><a href="#ref1">[1, pg.156]</a></sup>. Statistical speaking the teenagers who don't have a sexual life are considered abnormal. In other words, more than ever, modern couple acclaims the importance and psychological value of sexuality for the authenticity and the viability of the relationship such as. Based on field investigation, Laumann and co <sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup> reports that among young American adults, only 5% of the women and 2% of the men, had for the first time sexual intercourse on the wedding night. </p>


        <p>In our country sexual permissiveness has expanded not just among teenagers and young adults, but also to their parents and the general population; the traditional mentality suffered visible cracks. Generally, a person's values and attitudes are the best predictors of sexual behavior. Teens who start their sexual life at an early age appreciate more being independent and are more influenced by the opinions of friends than family. </p>
        <p>By Michael Newcomb and his colleagues <sup><a href="#ref3">[3]</a></sup> <strong>premarital sexual activity</strong> is more circulated among teenagers who see the meetings as something important and manage a strong desire for a partner and for the companionship. The importance of meetings has been associated with the following features:  </p>

        <p><ul>
          <li>the trust being popular and attractive to the opposite sex;</li>
          <li>a positive vision and accepting yourself; </li>
          <li>more experiences that involve physically stressful events or related to family. </li>
        </ul></p>


        <p>The importance of meetings, a predictor of premarital sexual activity, was correlated with both positive factors (personal and social trust) as well as negative experiences (stress). </p>

        <p><strong>Family structure</strong> is also connected to the premarital sexual activity. Among adolescents, girls who grew up without a father are more disposed to premarital sexual intercourse than others, according to Brehm <sup><a href="#ref4">[4]</a></sup>. In the case of boys, there is a different pattern. Their sexual activity increases when there is a change in their family, such as, for example, loss of a family member. </p>
        <p>There are also opinions that support the idea that children who come from families where they discuss about sex have more liberal tendencies. Also, it was noticed that the girls who come from families where there is a traditional attitude toward sexual relationships, manifest a reduced sexual experience, while the guys, on the contrary, it emphasizes the relationship of sexual manner. </p>

        <p>The strongest differences between sexual attitudes are associated with the genre. On average, boys are more permissive in terms of their values and attitudes towards sex, is engaging in sexual intercourse more quickly even in the absence of feelings, compared with girls. Also, if it comes married men their extramarital affairs, are considered by some as sexual performance, while, in the case of married women, they signify a certain unhappiness in marriage. </p>

        <p>Researches have tried to establish if there is any connection between the date at which couples begin their sexual relationships (earlier in the course of relationship or later) and the success of the relationship as it stands <sup><a href="#ref5">[5, pg. 193]</a></sup>. It was found that those couples who begin sexual relationships later, partners express more love one another.</p>

        <p>Other research, by contrary, suggests that women who began sexual relations later in the relationship of the couple, are complaining of reduce sexual satisfaction. It seems, also, by the author above quoted, that the debut of the couple's sexual relations cannot be correlated with the duration of the relationship of the couple. For a long time, stability of the relationship of a couple, and its quality was related to the frequency of sexual relations. New research reveals that although the happier couples report a number of sexual relationships increased, frequency of sexual relations is less important to the success of the relationship of the couple than common activities carried out jointly by the partners of the couple. To remember is that recent research has shown that the sex is far from the panacea that was believed to be. Sexual relationships are just a part of human relationships in general, and those of partners in particular. It seems as much widespread belief that a solid couple is founded on successful sexual intercourse is false. On the contrary, it shows the author, successful sex is owned mostly to a successful relationship. </p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft" style="size: 5em !important;"><strong>1. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY</strong></h3></p>
        
        <p><h3 class="titleLeft" style="padding-left: 10px !important; size: 0.8em !important;"><strong>1.1 RESEARCH OBJECTIVES</strong></h3></p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Identifying the period of onset of sexual life in teens </li>
            <li>To identify the underlying reasons for starting the sexual lives of teens (curiosity, the influence of friends, family, etc.) </li>
            <li>Identify sources of information that teens appeal to, about sexuality issues. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft" style="padding-left: 10px !important; size: 0.8em !important;"><strong>1.2 RESEARCH HYPOTHESES</strong></h3></p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Suppose that teenagers begin their sexual life at an early age </li>
            <li>Suppose that the main factor of sexual initiation in adolescence is curiosity determined by "culture conditions" </li>
            <li>Suppose teenagers rather informs from group of friends and the internet about issues related to sexuality, than from trusted sources. </li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft" style="padding-left: 10px !important; size: 0.8em !important;"><strong>1.3 RESEARCH METHODS</strong></h3></p>
        <p>In assessment private life in adolescents operate with a self-administrated questionnaire developed which follow all the rules of developing a specific methodological requirements questionnaire. </p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft" style="padding-left: 10px !important; size: 0.8em !important;"><strong>1.4 THE SAMPLE OF THE RESEARCH</strong></h3></p>
        <p>The sample of this research consists of a total of 50 subjects from Targu Mures High school, aged between 17 and 20 years, including 20 boys and 30 girls, from both urban and rural area.</p>


        <p><h3 class="titleLeft" style="size: 5em !important;"><strong>2. RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION</strong></h3></p>
        
        <p><h3 class="titleLeft" style="padding-left: 10px !important; size: 0.8em !important;"><strong>2.1 SEXUAL DEBUT</strong></h3></p>
        <p>Of all investigated subjects, as can be seen in the figure below, 92% started their sexual life, which was considered extremely worrying in my view, given the fact that the education system in Romania does not favor the initiation of mandatory sex education programs for students. </p>
        <p>With reference to the kind subjects, we found that of those who have already started their sex life, 94% are boys and 90% are girls. </p>
        <p>With regard to the onset age of sexual life, we see that for 2% of subjects happened at age 13, the percentage increasing to age 14 (18%) ascends to 28% at age 15 years and dominates with 34% at 16 years. Only 14% of the subjects started their sexual life to 17 years and 4% at 18 years. </p>
        <p>Regarding the number of sexual partners we found that 40% of subjects had the investigated between 2-3 partners until the research took place. Those who have had only one partner is a 30% followed by 14% who had partners between 5-10 people. Those who have had intimate relationships with more than 10 people representing a percentage of 8% of all subjects. </p>
        <p>Comparing the number of sexual partners in the kind of subjects, decipher the following: </p>
        <ul>
          <li> 51% of girls have already had between 2-3 partners, girls with one partner is a 40% and 3% of girls had 3-5 partners, other by 3% had 5-10 partners, respectively over 10 sexual partners. </li>
          <li> boys, with 30% had 5-10 partners, 20% had between 2-3 partners and equally 20% between 3-5 partners, 15% of subjects had one partner and also a percentage of 15 % represents the category of guys who had over 10 sexual partners.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft" style="padding-left: 10px !important; size: 0.8em !important;"><strong>2.2 DETERMINANT FACTORS OF SEXUAL INITIATION IN ADOLESCENTS</strong></h3></p>
        <p>From the data analysis supplied by the subjects we decipher that 66% of them started their intimate life out of curiosity, follow the 12% who have invoked the feeling of love. Close group of friends influencing sexual debut for 8% of the total subjects, 14% invoking other reasons. </p>
        <p>With regard to distribution of responses on the kind of subjects we observe that in both genders predominant curiosity (in 75% of boys and 60% girls). Love is a reason why 20% of girls in return it is insignificant for boys, 15% of them being influenced by friends. A percentage of 17% of girls are influenced by other factors. </p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft" style="padding-left: 10px !important; size: 0.8em !important;"><strong>2.3 THE PLACE THE MEDIA SOURCES AND MULTIMEDIA SERVICES IN ADOLESCENT SEXUAL LIFE</strong></h3></p>
        <p>The chart below shows off the sources of inspiration for adolescent sexual life. We observe that girls in the proportion of 54% are inspired on the internet, 23% of erotic magazines, 10% from other sources. A percentage of 10% of girls not looking inspiration, erotic movies are a source for 3% of them. </p>
        <p>Boys used as a primary source of the Internet, in a proportion of 40% erotic movies having a much higher than girls (30% vs 3%). 15% use other sources, and magazines are sought by 10% of boys. </p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft" style="padding-left: 10px !important; size: 0.8em !important;"><strong>2.4 OPENING THEME TO THE SUBJECTS 'SEXUAL LIFE' THEIR LEVEL OF INFORMING AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY</strong></h3></p>

        <p>Consider a sample normality the subjects discussed in our 54% girls and 55% boys the person concerned (boyfriend / a partner / a) their sexual life. Girls 23% prefer to discuss first between friends than with parents about intimate life his partner, at guys that percentage is 45%, which indicates that boys do not discuss this topic with their parents.</p>
        <p>In the case of contraception, we found that among boys, 95% use condoms and only 5% of them do not use protection. In return, for the girls, 56% do not use any form of contraception, and 44% use contraceptives.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, their sexual debut coincided with the beginning of infidelity, which indicates emotional instability, lack of self-knowledge and a poor understanding and the accountability in relationships of deep nature. This thing follows from the fact that girls, in a proportion of 23% were unfaithful to their partners, the percentage is high among boys - 65% of them being unfaithful to their partners. </p>

        <p><h2>CONCLUSIONS</h2></p>
        <p>As the research results show the phenomenon is real teenage sexuality age and lately increased as amplore. What attracts attention is that young people do not take full responsibilities of their actions, both physically and especially mentally. Infidelity is very common among them, with serious repercussions on the development of their sexual lives as adults. The fact that they start their sexual curiosity level denotes a psycho-affective immaturity. Many of them get information from sources on the internet, movies, friends and family too few talks about their sexual life. Educational programs for a healthy sex life are almost nonexistent in the system, though, as evidenced by the results of our research would be extremely useful, since preadolescence. Do not forget not prepared psychological and educational repercussions on sexuality in adolescents: increasing cases of sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, the growth in teenage abortion and abandonment of children born "by accident". Even if the work comes with detected data, is a warning signal for the parents, school counselors, teachers, the magnitude of this phenomenon among adolescents in the idea of finding and implementing educational solutions that lead to the formation of healthy habits, the a healthy and responsible lifestyle from a very young age. </p>
