        <p>Sexuality education is a lifelong process in which individuals gather information and form attitudes and beliefs about such topics as anatomy, reproduction, sexual development, sexual orientation, gender, relationships, and sexual behavior. Individuals learn about sexuality from parents, peers, teachers, and society. Still, the concept of sexuality education (often rendered as "sex education", or even "sex ed") tends to evoke images of high‐school classrooms, because it is most often used to refer to school‐based classes for young people. In the United States, school‐based sexuality education programs have been controversial for more than 100 years, as various groups have argued over whether schools are an appropriate place to address sexuality, which topics should be included, and what the ultimate messages and goals of such programs should be.</p>

        <p>Sexuality education is a lifelong process in which individuals gather information and form attitudes and beliefs about such topics as anatomy, reproduction, sexual development, sexual orientation, gender, relationships, and sexual behavior. As people grow, the knowledge they've acquired and the values they've developed ultimately inform their own sexual behavior and relationships. Therefore it is important that everyone has both access to accurate information about sexuality and help in developing the critical thinking skills needed to make healthy decisions.</p>

        <p>Individuals learn about sexuality from parents, peers, teachers, and society. Such learning starts in infancy (for example, when a baby is told the names of his or her body parts) and continues through adulthood. Still, the concept of sexuality education (often called "sex education", or even "sex ed") tends to evoke images of high‐school classrooms, because it is most often used to refer to school‐based classes for young people. In the United States, school‐based sexuality education programs have been controversial for more than 100 years, as various groups have argued over whether schools are an appropriate place to address sexuality, what topics should be included, and what the ultimate messages and goals of such programs should be.</p>

        <p><h2>Competing philosophies</h2></p>

        <p>Since sexuality education began, there has been an ongoing struggle between those who wanted to use these programs to control behaviors and to promote a specific set of morality rules and those who saw them as a way to help young people understand, accept, and more fully enjoy their sexuality. <a href="#goldfarb2009">Goldfarb (2009</a>:8) explains that the first approach was "articulated and advanced by social reformers who focused on sexual behaviors and advocated for education as a means to reduce out‐of‐wedlock sex and pregnancies, as well as venereal disease, masturbation, prostitution, and any nonprocreative sexual behaviors". In contrast, the second approach "took a broader view of sexuality as a life‐long human force—and as a source of pleasure—that needed to be understood and appreciated for better mental, physical, social, and spiritual health". Goldfarb suggests that the first approach is what we commonly think of as sex education, while the latter is better defined as sexuality education. Though within the field these two terms may have nuanced meanings, more often than not they are used interchangeably.</p>

        <p>Which philosophy is prevailing has changed many times during the last century on the basis of numerous cultural, sociological, and political factors. Efforts in the early 1900s, for example, focused on repressing sexual behavior in order to prevent both venereal diseases and "vice" (namely prostitution); but by the 1940s sex education began to take a more positive and broader approach. By the 1960s and 1970s sexuality education had expanded not just in topics, but in mission as well. As <a href="#goldfarb2009">Goldfarb (2009</a>:19) puts it: "Having come a long way from the early sex education movement, which focused on avoidance, control, and suppression of sexual understanding, the new sexuality education took on a broad perspective studying the role of sexuality in human life". Moreover, rather than assume the existence of one set of "correct" beliefs or moralities, these programs wanted students to explore their own values around sexuality. Predictably, this led to backlash from conservatives, who felt that a generation of young people was being raised without proper moral guidance when it came to sexuality. They began to push for "chastity education" programs designed to prevent teen pregnancy (as well as "out‐of‐wedlock" pregnancy) by promoting chastity and self‐discipline. These programs, which received a small amount of federal funding in the early 1980s, sparked the abstinence‐only‐until‐marriage movement, in which proponents lobbied parents, school boards, and eventually the federal government for strict programs that would teach young people that sexual behavior outside of marriage was harmful and immoral (<a href="#kempner2007">Kempner 2007</a>). Such programs received over one and a half billion dollars from the federal government between 1996 and 2010, before falling out of favor during the first Obama administration.</p>

        <p>Though abstinence‐only‐until‐marriage programs represented a clear return to the early days of sex education, in which the goal was to repress sexual behavior, proponents of these programs were politically savvy and took a different approach when trying to sway parents, educators, and politicians. They argued that teen sexual behavior was leading to epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and unintended pregnancies and promised that abstinence‐only programs that took a hard line against teen sex were the answer to these two problems.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, proponents of comprehensive sexuality education programs often took a public health and disease prevention approach too when advocating for their programs. Support for sexuality education in the schools went up around the country in the face of the AIDS epidemic, as fear of this new disease spread and parents began to understand the importance of arming young people with information. States also stepped in and began to mandate HIV education in schools. (Today 29 states require schools to provide some information on this topic.) Though the increase in public support was good, the programs that resulted were limited. In fact, HIV/AIDS education often replaced more comprehensive programs that had discussed a variety of issues in sexuality, including relationships, sexual behavior, and sexual orientation.</p>

        <p>Moreover, the political environment and success of the conservative abstinence‐only movement made many sexuality educators feel that they had to justify their programs by proving that they "worked". The more amorphous goals of comprehensive sexuality education—having a positive view of sexuality and becoming a sexually healthy adult—took a back seat to immediate, demonstrable goals such as reducing sexually transmitted diseases and pregnancy in teens.</p>

        <p><h2>Different types of schoolbased sexuality education programs</h2></p>
        <p>As a result of these competing philosophies and of the fact that decisions about sexuality education in the United States are made at the local level, schools today take many different approaches. These approaches are often categorized as abstinence‐only‐until‐marriage programs, abstinence‐plus programs, or comprehensive sexuality education, though in truth there is a great deal of variation in what young people actually learn from classroom to classroom. Moreover, the definitions of these terms often vary depending on who is using them and what these people believe.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Comprehensive sexuality education (CSE)</h3></p>
        <p>The National Sexuality Education Standards, Core Content and Skills, K‐12, which was developed by a coalition of organizations that supports broad‐based sexuality education, defines CSE this way:</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileyhs/sexuality_education/0#wbiehs471-bib-0002" class="isBlockQuote">A planned, sequential, Pre‐K–12 curriculum that is part of a comprehensive school health approach which addresses age‐appropriate physical, mental, emotional and social dimensions of human sexuality. It should allow students to develop and demonstrate developmentally appropriate sexual health‐related knowledge, attitudes, skills and practices. The curriculum should be designed to motivate and assist students to maintain and improve their sexual health by delaying sexual initiation, preventing disease and too‐early pregnancy and reducing sexual health‐related risk behaviors. The comprehensive sexuality education curriculum should include a variety of topics, including anatomy, physiology, families, personal safety, health relationships, abstinence, pregnancy and birth, sexually transmitted diseases (including HIV), contraceptives, sexual orientation, pregnancy options, medical literacy and more. It should be medically accurate, and provided by qualified, trained teachers. (<a href="#sexinitiative2012">Future of Sex Education Initiative 2012</a>)</blockquote>

        <p>In debates about sexuality education, however, the term "CSE" is often used by its opponents to describe any program that teaches young people about contraceptives, and especially about condoms.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Abstinence-only-until-marriage programs</h3></p>
        <p>This term represents the other end of the spectrum: programs that focus almost exclusively on the importance of marriage and the need to avoid all sexual activity until marriage. These programs sometimes discuss sexually transmitted diseases and unintended pregnancy as a consequence of sexual activity outside of marriage; but other topics such as anatomy, physiology, reproduction, sexual orientation, and gender identity are rarely included. Many of these programs do not discuss contraceptive methods, and those that do often emphasize failure. Abstinence‐only‐until‐marriage programs began as religious curricula, and many continue to include religious teachings or undertones. Finally, some of these programs rely on negative messages about sexuality, distorted information, and biases based on gender, sexual orientation, marriage, family structure, and pregnancy option.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Abstinence-plus or abstinence-based programs</h3></p>
        <p>If CSE and abstinence‐only‐until‐marriage programs represent two ends of the philosophical spectrum, abstinence‐plus or abstinence‐based programs have become names for the variation that lies in the middle. The programs emphasize the benefits of abstinence, although they do not frame their discussions about marriage. These programs also often include information on contraception and disease prevention.</p>

        <p><h2>Research weighs in</h2></p>
        <p>There is clear evidence that abstinence‐only‐until‐marriage programs do not work. A 2007 study commissioned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services looked at four of over 700 federally funded programs of this type. These programs were not randomly selected but handpicked as the best. The study compared students in the programs to a control group of peers in the same communities who did not attend the program. Researchers surveyed both groups of teens about their knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to sex before the program, immediately after the program, and again between four and six years after the program ended. They found very little difference between those who had been exposed to the abstinence‐only message and those who had not. Specifically, they found no evidence that abstinence‐only‐until‐marriage programs increased rates of sexual abstinence among students; students in these programs had a similar age of first sex and similar numbers of sexual partners as their peers who were not in the programs.</p>

        <p>That same year, the British Medical Journal published a meta‐review of 13 evaluations of abstinence‐only programs. Combined, the studies included almost 16,000 students (<a href="#underhill2007">Underhill et al. 2007</a>; see also <a href="http://www.siecus.org/index.cfmfuseaction=Page.ViewPage&PageID=1195#_edn3" target="-_blank">http://www.siecus.org/index.cfmfuseaction=Page.ViewPage&PageID=1195#_edn3</a>. The analysis found that such programs were ineffective in changing any behaviors, including rate of vaginal sex, number of sexual partners, and condom use. The rates of pregnancies and of STDs among participants in abstinence‐only‐until‐marriage programs were not impacted either. There is also a great deal of research that shows that giving young people honest information about both abstinence and contraception does not make them have sex sooner, does not make them have sex more often, and does not make them have sex with more partners. In fact just the opposite is true—young people who go through this kind of sexuality education are more likely to delay sex, have fewer partners, and use condoms and other contraceptive methods when they do become sexually active.</p>

        <p>The programs that have been found to be most successful in changing young people's behavior, however, are not those that take the broadest, most comprehensive approach. Research has found that programs that "focus on reducing one or more sexual behaviors that lead to unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections, including HIV" (<a href="#kirby2001">Kirby 2001</a>:131) are the most effective. Other characteristics of effective programs are that (1) they deliver and consistently reinforce a clear message about abstaining from sexual activity and/or using condoms or other forms of contraception; (2) they provide basic and accurate information about the risks of teen sexual activity and about ways to avoid intercourse or ways to use methods of protection against pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections; (3) they include activities that address social pressures that influence sexual behavior; (4) they provide examples of, and practice with, communication, negotiation, and refusal skills; (5) they last for a sufficient amount of time (i.e., more than a few hours).</p>

        <p>As a result of these findings, there is now a focus on evidence‐based sexuality education programs; these are defined as programs that have been proven, through rigorous research, to reduce risky sexual behavior. Under the Obama administration federal funding has been tied, in large part, to a list of evidence‐based programs. While many see this as an improvement over funding abstinence‐only‐until‐marriage programs that did not work, the policy continues to emphasize pregnancy and disease prevention as the goals of sex education. Some fear that the broader‐based goals—of long‐term sexual health and fulfillment—are lost.</p>

        <p><h2>The European model</h2></p>
        <p>Some experts believe that the United States should look to its European neighbors for answers on how best to educate young people about sexuality. European countries have fewer incidents of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases among young people than the United States, and teens in these countries tend to delay sex longer than U.S. teens. After studying the approach taken in the Netherlands, Germany, and France, Advocates for Youth concluded that these nations "expend less time and effort trying to prevent young people from having sex and more time and effort in educating and empowering young people to behave responsibly when they decide to have sex" (<a href="#berne1999">Berne and Huberman 1999</a>:v).</p>

        <p>These countries not only provide school-based sex education, they run mass media campaigns about safer sex and have health programs that make contraception available to young people. In the end, however, their success likely comes down to society's attitudes and norms.</p>

        <blockquote class="isBlockQuote">
          It is the openness and the acceptance that young people will have intimate sexual relationships without being married and that these relationships are natural and contribute to maturing into a sexually healthy adult. It is the refusal to brand the expression of sexuality as deviant behavior or to cast it solely in a negative light. It is the determination to present sexual expression as a balance—a normal part of growing up and a responsibility to protect oneself and others. It is the respect these societies have for adolescents, valuing them as much for who they are as for the adults they will become. <p>(<a href="#berne1999">Berne and Huberman 1999</a>:vi)</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The United States is a long way from accepting teenagers as sexual beings who are capable of making responsible decisions. It is therefore unlikely that the debate over sexuality education and the century‐long tug‐of‐war between competing philosophies will end soon.</p>
