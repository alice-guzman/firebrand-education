        <p>This entry identifies common adult misunderstandings about childhood sexuality and the consequent inadequacy of most children's learnings about sexuality. It describes the psychosocial, cognitive, and sexual stages of development and the five universal needs of children as they grow toward sexually healthy adolescence and adulthood: affirmation; information; clarity about values; limit‐setting; and anticipatory guidance. It provides a variety of specific recommendations to assist adults in establishing the open and honest communication that will enable them to give the critical support that is essential if children are to become sexually healthy, responsible adults.</p>

        <p>When my son Robby was age six, his first‐grade teacher asked him and his classmates to draw a picture of one of their parents at work. Robby drew me standing at a blackboard teaching about sexuality, which is exactly what I do at work. So, logically, the board read "SEX," and the bubble coming out of my mouth announced: "Sex is when two married people join the egg and the sperm." While incomplete, it was a thoroughly age‐appropriate explanation of the word.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, Robby's teacher responded—as many U.S. teachers and parents might—by calling his work "inappropriate" without further explanation. Thus Robby, like many U.S. children, received his first lesson about the discomfort adults often express with the subject of sex.</p>

        <p>This story serves as an important case study for understanding how many adults view and understand childhood sexuality. While the teacher's eyes were drawn to the words "sex," "sperm," and "egg," a closer look at Robby's drawing would reveal that his primary interest was not "sex" at all. Robby's drawing was about me as a teacher and the classroom dynamics he imagined I experienced—students complaining about their grades, expressing boredom. The subject of sex was entirely incidental to the drawing.</p>

        <p><a href="#wilson1991">Pamela Wilson (1991)</a> notes this tendency for adults to interpret children's comments and questions about sex through an "adult lens," to project their own sexual attitudes and experiences when something quite different may be going on in the child's mind. In fact, many adults prefer not to associate the terms "sex" and "children" altogether. Imagining childhood sexuality through the "adult lens" conjures thoughts of adult sexual interests and behaviors, whereas what children need is for us to meet them where <em>they</em> are and to understand their unique learning needs. These include: a basic vocabulary for body parts; answers to simple questions driven by their own curiosity; the basics of reproduction and birth, gender, relationships, and families; privacy; and the prevention of sexual abuse.</p>

        <p>Children receive messages about sexuality from their parents and other caregivers, and these may be spoken or unspoken messages about their bodies, gender expectations, and other aspects of sexuality. The messages are embedded in common, everyday interactions and experiences. Examples include: naming the genitals with silly words or slang, or not naming them at all; frowning, or swatting a child's hand away from their genitals during diaper changing; birthday cards reinforcing social expectations about gender, such as celebrating how pretty a girl is or how athletic a boy is; and sexual imagery and innuendo on television, movies, and online.</p>

        <p>With so many inadvertent and often unhelpful messages about sexuality impacting children from a variety of sources, it is important that adults think deliberately about the healthy messages they want to give. Identifying age‐appropriate ways to communicate about sexuality involves understanding how children process information and what their needs are at various developmental stages. As Wilson points out in <a href="ref1991">When Sex is the Subject: Attitudes and Answers for Young Children (1991)</a>, children begin developing as sexual beings and learning who they are as sexual people from the moment they are born. She summarizes these stages of child psychosocial, cognitive, and sexual development, as follows:</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>
          
          <p><em>From birth to age two</em> children perceive the world in a literal manner and rely on their senses to take in new information. Their learning focuses on their own direct actions. It is developmentally appropriate for children at this age to explore their body parts, including their genitals, experience some genital response (vaginal lubrication, erections), and begin noticing the socially expected behaviors for boys and girls.</p>

          <p><em>At ages three and four</em> children think in concrete terms and become more aware of the world around them. It is difficult for children at this age to understand ideas that are not part of their direct experiences, so they try to make sense of abstract concepts like reproduction and pregnancy in terms of their current experiences. For example, a child who is told that a baby is growing in a woman's tummy might imagine that the woman ate the baby, or ate a seed that grew in her stomach. The child might also, quite reasonably, expect that the baby will come out the way all eaten things come out!</p>
        
        </li></ul>

        <p>It is developmentally appropriate for children at this age to continue touching their genitals, while also learning the difference between public and private places. Children are also curious about differences between male and female bodies, and may experiment with "doctor" games to find out information. They have a sense of their own gender identity, and begin questioning how they were born.</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>

          <p><em>At ages five through eight</em> children still think in concrete terms, but slowly begin to develop abstract thinking. Their ideas are influenced by a combination of what they experience directly, and what they read and observe. This progression toward more abstract thinking is perhaps best captured in the title of Deborah Roffman's book But How'd I Get There In the First Place? (2002).</p>

        </li></ul>

        <p>It is developmentally appropriate for children at this age to be curious about pregnancy and birth, have strong same‐sex friendships, and show an interest in stereotypical male/female roles. Children at this age who have a sense of gender nonconformity may feel "different," even though a solid sense of gender identity, sexual orientation, and attractions may be years away.</p>

        <p>In <a href="#ref2012">Talk to Me First: Everything You Need to Know to Become Your Kids' Go‐To Person about Sex (2012)</a>, Deborah Roffman identifies five universal needs children have as they grow toward sexually healthy adolescence and adulthood, and the five corresponding roles for adults in nurturing this process.</p>

        <p><em>Affirmation</em>: Children need adults to validate their emerging sexuality by establishing themselves as resources and "go‐to" people; by remaining open and non‐judgmental about children's questions and concerns; and by being supportive and realistic about their ongoing maturation and growth.</p>

        <p><em>Information</em>: Children need factual knowledge and concepts regarding the broad topic of human sexuality, presented in ongoing and age‐appropriate ways, and in the same kind of learning spiral that adults provide around all other subjects from the earliest ages onward.</p>

        <p><em>Clarity about values</em>: Children need adults to intentionally share their own personal values concerning all pertinent aspects of sexuality; to clarify and help children evaluate competing values and value systems in the larger culture; and to teach them how to apply ethical values to sexual decision making.</p>

        <p><em>Limit‐setting</em>: Children need adults to create healthy and safe environments by stating and reinforcing age‐appropriate rules and limits, with the goal, ultimately, of teaching young people how to set their own safe and healthy limits, and how to respect others.</p>

        <p><em>Anticipatory guidance</em>: Children need adults to help them learn how to avoid or handle potentially harmful situations and to prepare them for times when they will need to rely on themselves to make responsible and healthy choices.</p>

        <p>Additional ways to help young children develop into sexually healthy adolescents and adults include the following:</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>

          <p><em>Give accurate information</em>. Responses should always be simple, honest, and accurate and within the child's developmental stage. This establishes the adult as a trustworthy source and lays a foundation for future open communication. A child who learns from an adult that babies come from storks will eventually learn that the adult gave them misinformation, and will likely seek out other sources to have their questions answered honestly. Books, such as those listed at the end of this entry, can help adults ensure they are giving accurate information. If an adult is unsure of the answer, s/he can praise the child for asking and offer to find out the information together.</p> 

          <p><em>Use a calm, matter‐of‐fact tone</em>. <a href="#wilson1991">Wilson (1991)</a> speaks of the "music" with which adults surrounds adult‒child conversations about sex. Children might not recall the exact information they learned, but they will recall the tone of those conversations. A positive, calm, and matter‐of‐fact tone signals that the adult is approachable and will help facilitate open communication throughout life. Children can sense anxiety and discomfort, so practicing a measured, calm tone of voice can be helpful.</p>

          <p><em>Remember that children are naturally curious</em>. Curiosity about bodies is just one more part of a child's desire to learn. Adults can help by giving factual information about bodies, reading with children, and recognizing that games of "doctor" are common ways to discover answers to their questions. Adults may intervene if such behaviors seem nonconsensual (e.g., one child is pressuring the other child to play). When stopping such exploration, the adult may redirect children in ways that still affirm their curiosity without punishment. Having children examine the colorful, illustrated images of bodies in a book such as It's Not the Stork (<a href="#harris2006">Harris 2006</a>) can serve as a helpful alternative way to have their questions answered, affirming the child's need for knowledge. Adults can also explain that it is not always appropriate to look at other people's bodies, teaching them about respecting privacy.</p>

          <p><em>Encourage a healthy body image</em>. All children should know that bodies of all sizes and shapes are special. Affirm different body types, while also encouraging a nutritious diet and an appropriate amount of physical activity. By teaching children about health and hygiene and how to take care of their bodies, parents can help children establish independence and a healthy body image.</p>

          <p><em>Use correct language for genitals</em>. It is important to use correct terminology for sexual anatomy, just as it is for all parts of the body. When children are taught accurate words for their anatomy ("penis" and "scrotum"; "vulva," "vagina," and "clitoris") they learn that their sexual anatomy is natural and integrated with all their other body parts. Vague or non‐serious language—and leaving sexual anatomy unnamed—teaches children to associate silliness or shame with their bodies and may cause them to feel detached from their own body parts.</p>

          <p>Some adults, uncomfortable with the words "vulva" and "clitoris," rely on "vagina" to cover all the parts of female sexual anatomy. This is similar to pointing to one's entire face and calling it the "mouth." Avoiding the correct terminology for sexual anatomy can result in feelings of shame or guilt around these body parts. Naming the body parts can also be helpful in the prevention of sexual abuse. Correct terminology and comfort discussing their sexual anatomy can help give a child the language and confidence to tell a predator that it is not OK to touch them, or to accurately report a person who has tried to touch them inappropriately</p>

          <p><em>Teach about privacy</em>. Touching one's own genitals is a natural and healthy part of childhood development, and it is important to set appropriate limitations on this behavior without making the child feel ashamed, guilty, or that they are being punished. Children need to learn that their genitals are private and that their right to privacy should be respected by others. Privacy rights include the nonsexual body parts too; for example, a child's right to decline being kissed. Healthy development includes establishing one's body rights—the message that their bodies belong to them and no one should touch them without their permission except for certain situations (e.g., a medical exam). Parents can help children develop in a healthy way by teaching about private places (bedroom, bathroom, bathtub) where it's OK to touch their bodies.</p>

          <p><em>Use teachable moments</em>. In her books From Diapers to Dating and Beyond the Big Talk, <a href="#haffner1999">Haffner (1999, 2001)</a> stresses the need for continuous communication about sex, not just a single moment known as "the talk." "Teachable moments" include situations from daily life or from movies and television programs that serve as great launching points for conversation. Sentences that begin with "What do you think about…?" and "What would you do if…?" help children apply fictional and real‐life situations to their own developing values and decision‐making capacities</p>

        </li></ul>

        <p>Many adults wonder about how to answer children's questions about sex. In <em>Healthy Foundations</em>, <a href="#montfort1993">Sue Montfort, Peggy Brick, and Nancy Blume (1993)</a> describe a step‐by‐step process for answering questions:</p>

        <ul style="list-style-type: none;"><li>

          <p><em>Reassure the child that it is good to ask questions</em>. This first step may be more important than the answer itself. Telling a child, "That's a great question!" helps set an approachable tone, empowering the child to ask more questions.</p>

          <p><em>Find out what the child knows and is really asking</em>. Before providing an answer, it is important to understand the question from the child's point of view. Asking questions, such as "What do you think?" and "What have you heard about that?," gives the child an opportunity to share his or her own knowledge. Then, the adult's answer can build on the child's existing knowledge. A girl who asks why boys stand up when they pee, for example, might not be wondering about male reproductive anatomy; she might be wondering about fairness!</p>

          <p><em>Decide on the message to give</em>. Messages may be spoken or unspoken, and may be positive or negative. Some empowering messages include: "It's good to ask me questions," "It's good to be curious about these things," "You can learn correct words from me," and "You are fine just the way you are."</p>

          <p><em>Answer honestly and simply, and use the correct vocabulary</em>. Answers should be age‐ and developmentally appropriate, building on a child's existing knowledge of the subject. For example, when a child points to a tampon and asks, "What's that?" a parent might become flustered, wondering, "Is it too soon to talk about periods?" But sometimes children just want to know that everything has a name. So the simple answer, "That's a tampon," may be all that is needed to satisfy the child's curiosity.</p>

          <p><em>Encourage feedback</em>. Check for comprehension by asking, "Does that make sense?" or "So what do you think about that?" or "What else would you like to know?" Then give additional feedback, as needed.</p>

          <p><em>If appropriate, use additional resources</em>. There are many excellent resources for answering young children's sexual questions. (See the end of this entry for a list of great books.)</p>

        </li></ul>

        <p>In summary, adults have the opportunity to establish a foundation of open and honest communication around children's healthy sexual development, one that that will provide critical support as they develop into adolescents and young adults. Children who have positive experiences communicating with adults about sexual topics will be confident and knowledgeable, feel good about their bodies, and become capable of making healthy sexual decisions later in life. In a country that has the highest rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections among the industrialized nations, effective, empowering communication with children might be one of the keys to reducing these alarmingly high statistics. Moreover, positive approaches with children should serve to empower young people to become sexually healthy, responsible adults.</p>
