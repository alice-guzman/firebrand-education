        <p>From about a decade ago, Gonadotropin Releasing Hormone analogues (GnRHa) have been used to delay puberty in adolescents with gender dysphoria. The suppression of puberty is considered to be a diagnostic aid. It allows adolescents to explore their gender identity and delay decisions about the actual gender reassignment (consisting of cross‐sex hormone treatment and various types of surgery) without having to fear the physical pubertal development. The effects of puberty suppression in early adolescence are reversible; once the use is interrupted puberty continues to develop. Follow‐up studies are still scarce, but results so far look promising with respect to psychological functioning, health, and physical appearance. They do not support the view that waiting with physical interventions until adulthood is a better treatment option than intervening in adolescence.</p>

        <p>Gonadotropin‐releasing hormone analogs (GnRHa) prevent the production of testosterone and estrogen by the testes and ovaries, by modifying the release of pituitary gonadotropins. If administered to a young adolescent who has not reached the final pubertal stage (Tanner stage 5), puberty will not further develop. Originally GnRHa were used in the treatment of children with central precocious puberty or CPP (<a href="#job1977">Job et al., 1977</a>). Since the late 1990s, they have also been used in the treatment of adolescents with gender dysphoria (also called transsexual adolescents or adolescents with gender incongruence). Puberty suppression is a fairly new aspect of the treatment of gender dysphoria and was developed in the Netherlands. According to treatment protocols (e.g., <a href="#hembree2009">Hembree et al. 2009</a>) GnRHa should only be prescribed after careful psychological evaluation. Eligibility requirements are a long‐lasting gender dysphoria that worsened with the onset of puberty, fulfilment of the criteria for a diagnosis of Gender Dysphoria (GD) according to the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association or of transsexualism according to the current International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems of the World Health Organization, and an absence of coexisting psychological, medical, or social problems that could seriously interfere with diagnostic assessment and treatment. The adolescent and caretakers have to give informed consent. Also, the adolescent should have entered puberty (Tanner stage 2-3). Tanner stages 2-3 are stages in which the first physical signs of puberty become visible, but are still reversible after puberty suppression. These first stages of puberty serve as a critical diagnostic stage, because while in most prepubertal children GD will desist, there is a high likelihood that GD will persist in pubertal adolescents. In some countries, there is also a minimum age limit of 12 years. Applicants preferably have regular medical check‐ups, once treatment has started, and see mental‐health clinicians to monitor the process and prepare them for any further treatment steps that might be taken.</p>

        <p>The purpose of this use of GnRHa is to allow adolescents and their families more time to monitor gender identity development, to make more informed decisions on any further treatment steps, and to obtain improved results in the physical appearance of those who will continue with the actual gender reassignment. Gender reassignment consists of cross‐sex hormone treatment, often available as early as the age of 16 and of surgeries (e.g. vaginoplasty for natal males or phalloplasty, mastectomy and ovariectomy/ oophorectomy for natal females) at the legal age of majority. The introduction of GnRHa has made it possible for young adolescents to contemplate decisions on gender reassignment without the distress of an increasingly maturing body. If adolescents would change their minds and stop using GnRHa, puberty according to their natal sex would restart within weeks.</p>

        <p>A complete social transition (living on a daily basis in the role of the experienced gender, using a new first name etc.) is not required when taking GnRHa. Puberty suppression is considered to be a diagnostic aid rather than a first step of the actual gender reassignment. The use of GnRHa has opened new possibilities for alleviating the distress with which many gender dysphoric adolescents struggle. Since this intervention was offered for the first time, however, increasing numbers of adolescents who start using GnRHa do choose to socially transition as well.</p>

        <p>Concerns that have been raised about this treatment include the risk of making wrong treatment decisions. Some feel that adolescents are in such a turbulent phase of life that they may not be capable of making decisions with lifelong consequences. In addition, they believe it is, in principle, not possible to make a correct diagnosis of GD during adolescence, and that therefore chances are high that adolescents would regret their treatment. Advocates of puberty suppression have emphasized the harmful effects of withholding treatment and the beneficial effects of GnRHa on the adolescents' mental health, on their quality of life, and on having a physical appearance that makes it possible to live unobtrusively in the desired gender role.</p>

        <p>From the few studies that have been published thus far, it seems that the benefits outweigh the risks (<a href="#kreukels2011">Kreukels and Cohen‐Kettenis 2011</a>). Starting the process of gender reassignment with GnRHa treatment seems to result in an improved quality of life. Currently, there are no indications that GnRHa treatment (followed by administration of cross‐sex hormones and gender‐reassignment surgery) results in physical or psychological harm. Compared to individuals who are treated later in life (adulthood), early treated youth function better psychologically. However, long‐term follow‐up studies and specifically studies on the effects on cognitive brain functioning are still needed.</p>
