        <p style="margin-top: 0;">Gender differences in sexual behaviors and attitudes are often empirically examined. However, the generalizability and the size of gender differences remained unaddressed. In 1993, Oliver and Hyde conducted a meta‐analysis to estimate the magnitude of gender differences in sexual behaviors and attitudes and found that many were small. In 2010, Petersen and Hyde conducted an updated analysis with current research and seven large national data sets. Gender differences were analyzed in 30 reported sexual behaviors and attitudes, and the results suggested that men reported more masturbation and use of pornography and more permissive attitudes about casual sex than women. However, most (26 out of 30) of the gender differences in attitudes and behaviors were small. These results suggest that gender similarities in sexuality are common; they also emphasize that gender similarities could contribute to gender equality in sexual expression.</p>

        <p><h2>Background</h2></p>

        <p>Women and men are often thought to be different from each other in a number of ways, and sexuality is no exception. The most theorized and widespread of these beliefs is that men have more sexual experience and hold more permissive attitudes than women. These and other gender differences have been investigated through numerous empirical studies (<a href="#baumeister2001">Baumeister et al. 2001</a>; <a href="#fisher2012">Fisher et al. 2012</a>). Research often finds gender differences; however, several questions generally have gone unanswered. Are these gender differences specific to the sample (e.g., a college sample) or are they generalizable? How <em>large</em> are these gender differences in sexuality? Meta‐analytic results are able to provide answers for these questions and others.</p>

        <p><h2>Meta‐analyses on gender differences</h2></p>

        <p>In 1993 Oliver and Hyde conducted a meta‐analysis to synthesize the findings of earlier research and provide a systematic, quantitative assessment of gender differences in sexual behaviors and attitudes. Eleven attitudes and ten behaviors were assessed, including reported incidence of vaginal sex, extramarital sexual behavior, attitudes toward casual sex, attitudes toward homosexuality, and attitudes toward masturbation. The results of that meta‐analysis indicated that men reported more sexual activity and more permissive attitudes than women for many, but not all, of the measures. Particularly, the meta‐analysis indicated that men were much more likely than women to report masturbation (<em>d</em> = 0.96) and permissive attitudes toward casual sex (<em>d</em> = 0.81); however, the gender differences for engaging in oral sex (<em>d</em> = 0.10) and for attitudes about masturbation (<em>d</em> = 0.09) were small.</p>

        <p>However, many cultural shifts have occurred since the 1993 meta‐analysis; for example, Internet use has increased dramatically and the political issue of civil liberties for same‐sex couples is much debated. These changes, among others, warranted an updated meta‐analysis, in order to determine if there has been a shift in gender differences in sexuality. In 2010, Petersen and Hyde used current research and seven large national data sets to provide a contemporary description of gender differences in sexuality.</p>

        <p>The <a href="#petersen2010">Petersen and Hyde (2010)</a> meta‐analysis consisted of two separate analyses. Analysis I was a traditional meta‐analysis in which a literature search for all published studies and unpublished dissertations written in English using PsycINFO and PubMed was performed. Analysis II included seven large national data sets based on probability sampling. Fourteen sexual <em>behaviors</em> were defined in the analysis, including frequency of intercourse; number of sexual partners; masturbation (incidence or frequency); and pornography use (incidence or frequency) (see <a href="#petersen2010">Petersen and Hyde 2010</a> for details concerning each measure). The meta‐analysis also assessed 16 sexual <em>attitudes</em>, including general sexual permissiveness; casual sex; double standard (males and females should be judged by different standards); and fear/anxiety/guilt. Like the <a href="#oliver1993">Oliver and Hyde (1993)</a> analysis, both Analysis I and Analysis II used effect size <em>d</em>; also, a small effect size is indicative of a small difference between women and men in behavior or attitude. (Cohen 1997 established a conventional interpretation in which an effect size <em>d</em> = 0.20 is small, an effect size <em>d</em> = 0.50 is medium, and an effect size <em>d</em> = 0.80 is large.)</p>

        <p>Analysis I used 730 studies with 1,419,807 participants (682,863 males and 736,944 females). The results indicated that, although male participants reported more sexual experiences for many of the measures, the effect sizes were mostly in the small range (<em>d</em> &leq; 0.20) according to Cohen's criteria, 28 percent of the effect size for sexual behaviors being less than or equal to 0.10. The largest gender differences occurred for three outcomes: male participants were more likely than female participants to report engaging in casual sex (<em>d</em> = 0.38), in masturbation (<em>d</em> =0.53), and in pornography use (<em>d</em> = 0.63). In addition, compared with females, males were somewhat more likely to report having more sexual partners (d = 0.36), having more extramarital affairs (<em>d</em> = 0.33), and engaging in cybersex (<em>d</em> = 0.14). None of the effect sizes for gender differences in behavior was large.</p>

        <p>The results for sexual attitudes were similar to those for sexual behaviors; 31 percent of the effect sizes were less than or equal to 0.10. For example, there was no gender difference for attitudes toward extramarital sex, attitudes toward sex when engaged to be married, attitudes toward masturbation, and attitudes toward lesbians. The largest gender difference was for attitudes about casual sex; males reported more permissive attitudes than females (<em>d</em> = 0.45). The findings of Analysis II, the large national data sets, were generally consistent with the results of Analysis I.</p>

        <p><a href="#peteresen2010">Petersen and Hyde (2010)</a> also included a measure of gender empowerment in their analyses, using the United Nation's gender empowerment measure (GEM), which assesses the extent of gender equality in countries across the world. The researchers found that countries with greater gender equality (higher scores on the GEM) had smaller gender differences for the reported incidence of intercourse, oral sex, anal sex, casual sex, masturbation, and attitudes toward gay marriage. This finding suggests that theories such as social structural theory, which proposes that psychological gender differences are a result of gender disparity in power (<a href="#eagly1999">Eagly and Wood 1999</a>), hold some validity when it comes to explaining gender differences in sexuality.</p>

        <p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p>

        <p>Individuals, the media, and researchers often emphasize the differences between men's and women's sexuality. Meta‐analytic data support the notion that men and women are similar in sexuality more than they are different. Gender differences for 26 of the 30 sexual behaviors and attitudes either displayed no difference or the differences were small. This finding supports the gender similarities hypothesis, which states that for most, though not all, psychological indicators men and women are similar (<a href="#hyde2005">Hyde 2005</a>). Continuing to exaggerate gender differences in sexuality can be problematic for both genders. These stereotypes run the risk of perpetuating the double standard and leaving women and men who violate the stereotypes feeling inferior or inadequate. Emphasizing gender similarities rather than differences may contribute to gender equality of sexual expression (<a href="#petersen2010">Petersen and Hyde 2010</a>).</p>
