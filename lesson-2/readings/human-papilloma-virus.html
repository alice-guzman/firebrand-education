		<p>HPV infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases and infections worldwide. At least 70 percent of sexually active individuals will be infected by one of the HPV genotypes at some point in their lives. HPV can be transmitted through vaginal, anal and oral sex, or simply skin‐to‐skin contact of the genitals. The risks of transmission are associated with age, smoking, number of sex partners, and oral contraceptive (OC) use, as well as high‐ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure, and so on. Persistent infection with high‐risk HPV‐types is associated with cancers, that is, cervical, anal, and head/neck cancers. There is no cure for HPV infection. HPV vaccines are effective at preventing infection and disease related to the vaccine‐specific genotypes with no evidence of past or current HPV infection. Preadolescent girls ranging from ages 9 to 13 are the target group for vaccination.</p>

		<p>Human papillomaviruses (HPV) are DNA viruses that infect basal epithelial (skin or mucosal) cells. HPV infection is one of the most common sexually transmitted diseases worldwide. Of the more than 130 types of HPVs that have been identified, approximately 40 are sexually transmitted</p>

		<p><h2>HPV transmission and risk factors</h2></p> 
		
		<p>HPV viruses are very common. At an alarming rate, more than 70 percent of sexually active individuals will be infected by one of the HPV genotypes at some point in their lives. HPV can be transmitted through vaginal sex, anal sex, oral sex, or skin‐to‐skin contact of the genitals, including mutual masturbation with genital touching. The vaginal and anal tracts are particularly susceptible to HPV and the risk of transmission is greatest during penetration without a condom. HPVs are also found in other body parts, such as the throat.</p>
		
		<p>There is an inverse relationship between age and HPV prevalence in many countries. In some countries, cross‐sectional and cohort studies have shown a U‐shaped curve with a first peak in women less than 30 years of age and a second peak in women aged 55-64 years. There is mixed scientific evidence for condoms as protection against HPV. Some cross‐sectional studies found no evidence for a reduction through condom use; however, lower HPV prevalence has been reported among women using condoms with their regular partners and a longitudinal study found that consistent condom use protected U.S. college students significantly against new HPV infections and appeared to protect against CIN (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia) lesion development. Smoking and HIV infection have consistently been associated with longer duration of HPV infection and risk for genital cancer. There is an increasing incidence of anal cancers, and a close association with HPV infection has been demonstrated. Receptive anal sex and HIV‐positive status are associated with a higher risk for anal cancers in both men and women. HPV infection risk is associated with the number of sex partners that the woman or her partner has had over a lifetime and recently. A protective effect against HPV infection and cervical cancer incidence has also been reported for women with circumcised partners. Fair complexion, tendency to burn, and high ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure as well as organ transplant recipients, are important populations at great risk for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) after HPV infections (Cutts et al. 2007). An association has been reported between oral contraceptive (OC) use, HPV and cervical cancer, and there could be a similar association for CSCC.</p>

		<p><h2>HPV‐associated cancers</h2></p>

		<p>Persistent infection with high‐risk HPV‐types is associated with cancers, but it is often a "silent infection." High‐risk HPVs are identified in more than 99 percent of patients with cervical cancer. Various genotype HPVs cause various degrees of cervical cancers. Types 16 and 18 are associated with high‐risk types of cervical cancer and are associated with 70 percent of all cervical cancers (<a href="#broomall2010">Broomall et al. 2010</a>). HPV is also associated with several less common cancers, such as vaginal and vulvar cancers in women, penis cancers in men, anal and head/neck cancers in both men and women.</p>

		<p><h2>Diagnosis, treatment, and prevention</h2></p>

		<p>There is no precise way to determine in which people HPV infections will persist and lead to cancer. But for women, routine Pap testing is an important screening tool for cervical cancer and allows early stage treatment with complete cure. There is no equivalent of Pap testing in males. Most HPV infections of the cervix are asymptomatic and more than 90 percent of detected infections are cleared within two years (<a href="#moscicki2006">Moscicki et al. 2006</a>). There is no cure for HPV infection, but some of the problems it causes can be treated. HPV vaccines are effective at preventing infection and disease related to the vaccine‐specific genotypes in women with no evidence of past or current HPV infection. HPV vaccines will reduce but not eliminate the risk of cervical cancer, and screening programs are important interventions for cervical cancer even after HPV vaccinations (<a href="#cutts2007">Cutts et al. 2007</a>). According to the recommendations by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control), women should receive cervical cancer screening at the age of 21 or three years after their first sexual encounter. The primary target age group for HPV vaccines is likely to be preadolescent girls ranging from ages 9 to 13, with a maximum age of 26 years for those not yet exposed to HPV types present in the vaccine. The ideal target age group is sexually naïve without any risk to HPV exposure (<a href="#herrero2003">Herrero et al. 2003</a>). A second target group is men who have sex with men (MSM), a population at risk for developing HPV‐related diseases such as anal cancer, penile cancer, and genital warts (<a href="#machalek2012">Machalek et al. 2012</a>). In addition, vaccination of young adolescent boys before the onset of sexual activity can also prevent HPV‐related diseases in all men instead of only MSM.</p>
