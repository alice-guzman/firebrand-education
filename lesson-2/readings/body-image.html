        <p>Body image is the evaluation of one's body, primarily in esthetic terms. Poor body image is implicated in clinical eating disorders, but its impact is much wider. Body image concerns are common among women and men, and are associated with engagement in body modification practices such as dieting, exercise, cosmetic surgery, and steroid use. Poor body image has been found to impact on sexual engagement and enjoyment.</p>
        
        <p>Body image refers to the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that a person has in relation to their own body. Its primary use is in relation to the perceived esthetics of the body, rather than its functionality. Although body image includes non‐evaluative beliefs about one's body, it is most commonly used to indicate satisfaction with the body, differentiating between people with "good" and "poor" body image. Extremely poor body image is the major criterion for the clinical diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder.</p>

        <p>Body image was originally studied primarily in relation to eating disorders, where it was conceptualized as both a symptom and a risk factor for clinical disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. The use of the more complex term "body image" in place of body satisfaction comes from the view that body dissatisfaction often arises from misperception of aspects of the body—particularly its size—and so highlights a psychological origin of poor body image. Many early studies showed that women and girls with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa perceived their bodies as being much larger than they actually were, and this misperception was considered to be a key factor in maintaining the refusal to gain weight that is a cardinal feature of anorexia nervosa. More recently, emphasis has shifted to identifying environmental and interpersonal influences on poor body image, particularly media influences. The proliferation of images of extremely thin women in all forms of visual media has been widely identified as a key factor in the increasing dissatisfaction of women and girls with their bodies, and in the rise of body modification practices, including dieting, exercise, and cosmetic surgery. The majority of current research into body image reflects this increasing emphasis on sociocultural factors, rather than internal psychological distortions. This shift is encapsulated in the widely adopted tripartite influence model (van den <a href="#berg2002">Berg et al. 2002</a>), which posits that broad cultural mandates for thinness are transmitted to girls via three main channels: parents, peers, and the media</p>

        <p><h2>Body image and gender</h2></p>

        <p>Body image is primarily considered a young women's issue, with most attention focused on the effects of media images of "the thin ideal" on girls and young women. The thin ideal refers to the images of unrealistically thin women that are put forward as ideals of feminine beauty, as well as the emphasis on diet and exercise regimes that normalize the pursuit of thinness as a taken‐for‐granted, shared goal of Euro‐American women. The pervasiveness of the thin ideal and its unattainability for most women has led to a situation in which body dissatisfaction is widespread, so much so that body image concern has come to be understood as a "normative discontent" (<a href="#rodin1984">Rodin et al. 1984</a>) among Euro‐American women. The influential "objectification theory" (<a href="#fredrickson1997">Fredrickson and Roberts 1997</a>) argues that the routine exposure to idealized images of ultra‐thin women creates a situation in which women and girls come to relate to their own bodies at least partly from an observer's perspective—as objects to be evaluated against the ideal, and almost always found wanting</p>

        <p>Although most public and scholarly concern has been with the effects of the thin ideal of women's body image, some attention has also been paid to the increasing presence of body‐focused images of men in the media, and their consequences for men's body image. These images, described as "the muscular ideal," feature men with highly developed musculature and very low body fat. Endorsement of the muscular ideal by men and boys has been associated with body image concerns, high levels of engagement in weight training, and illicit use of anabolic steroids to increase muscle mass.</p>

        <p><h2>Body image and sexuality</h2></p>
        <p>With the increased sexualization of culture seen in industrialized countries there has been a growing emphasis on having and displaying a sexy (thin) body. Body image is thus often considered to be a core component of a person's belief in their sexual desirability. A recent review of 57 studies examining the relationship between body image and sexuality in women (<a href="#woertman2012">Woertman and van den Brink 2012</a>) found that poor body image was associated with reduced engagement in and enjoyment of sexual activities. This review also found that poor body image in women was associated with more unwanted sexual activity and with more unprotected sex. Much less research has been conducted on the relationship between body image and sexuality among men, but some work suggests that body image concern in men is associated with less sexual enjoyment, and that body image concern is higher among gay men than among heterosexual men.</p>

        <p><h2>Body image beyond esthetics</h2></p>
        <p>From its origins in clinical psychology, body image has become the subject of more sociologically‐oriented readings. With the rise of concern about obesity in Euro‐American countries, body weight has become subject to increased attention in relation to health, as well as to esthetic concerns. This shift in focus has increased the surveillance of body weight, with families, employers, healthcare providers and even fellow citizens now having an apparently legitimate interest in the body weight of others. <a href="#bordo1993">Susan Bordo (1993)</a> has argued that the individualistic ideology of Euro‐American societies has created an intense focus on the body as a symbol of responsible self‐management, and that, increasingly, the "successful body" has come to represent successful personhood. This extends the impact of body image beyond those situations in which esthetics or sexual desirability are directly relevant concerns into almost every aspect of social life in contemporary industrialized countries.</p>
