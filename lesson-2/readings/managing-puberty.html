        <p>Gr 5 Up--Navigating the world of growing up can be tricky for adolescents and it can be hard to find just the right advice. The narrator in this video plays the role of the caring older sister as she gives helpful hints about puberty and social skills. The information presented is honest and straightforward, designed to help girls--particularly those with developmental challenges--understand what they can expect physically, mentally, and socially as they transition into womanhood. The narrator describes what happens physically during puberty, covering topics such as growth, menstruation, and conception. She offers suggestions about what girls can do when they don't feel good about themselves, such as focusing on their strengths, helping others, and keeping a gratitude journal. She discusses making friends and being social, defining what friendship is and stressing the need to pay attention to others' social cues. There's also basic advice on dating, understanding sexuality, and how to stay safe. An accompanying PDF provides additional resource material. Endorsed by a panel that includes psychologists, autism education experts, parents, teachers, and girls, this video can be a particularly valuable resource those with special needs.</p>
