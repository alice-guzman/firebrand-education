        <p><strong>Abstract</strong> Many studies have reported higher rates of suicide attempts among sexual minority individuals compared with their heterosexual counterparts. For suicides, however, it has been argued that there is no sexual orientation risk difference, based on the results of psychological autopsy studies. The purpose of this article was to clarify the reasons for the seemingly discrepant findings for suicide attempts and suicides. First, we reviewed studies that investigated if the increased suicide attempt risk of sexual minorities resulted from biased self-reports or less rigorous assessments of suicide attempts. Second, we reanalyzed the only two available case-control autopsy studies and challenge their original"no difference" conclusion by pointing out problems with the interpretation of significance tests and by applying Bayesian statistics and meta-analytical procedures. Third, we reviewed register based and clinical studies on the association of suicides and sexual orientation. We conclude that studies of both suicide attempts and suicides do, in fact, point to an increased suicide risk among sexual minorities, thus solving the discrepancy. We also discuss methodological challenges inherent in research on sexual minorities and potential ethical issues. The arguments in this article are necessary to judge the weight of the evidence and how the evidence might be translated into practice.</p>

        <p><strong>Keywords</strong> Suicide &bull; Sexual orientation &bull; Homosexuality &bull; Sexual minority &bull; Bayesian statistics</p>

        <p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>

        <p>Many individual studies, several study reviews, and two meta-analyses have concluded that sexual minority individuals report higher rates of suicide attempts than heterosexuals (e.g., Bagley &amp; Tremblay, <a href="#bagleytremblay2000">2000</a>; Haas et al., <a href="#haas2011">2011</a>; Kann et al., <a href="#kann2011">2011</a>; King et al., <a href="#king2008">2008</a>; Lewis, <a href="#lewis2009">2009</a>; Marshal et al., <a href="#marshal2011">2011</a>; McDaniel, Purcell, &amp; D'Augelli, <a href="#mcdanielpurcell2001">2001</a>; Meyer, <a href="#meyer2003">2003</a>; Ploderl, Sauer, &amp; Fartacek, <a href="#ploderlsauer2006">2006</a>; Russell, <a href="#russell2003">2003</a>). In this article, we use the term "sexual minority" to refer to individuals with a non-heterosexual self-identification (gay, lesbian, bisexual, unsure, queer), non-heterosexual behavior, or non-heterosexual attraction. In the most extensive literature overview (Ramsay &amp; Tremblay, <a href="#ramsaytremblay2012a">2012a</a>), the increased risk was found in nearly all studies conducted in many locations worldwide that used different sampling procedures, varying definitions of sex ual orientation, or type of publication (peer reviewed papers, books, dissertations, reports, etc.).</p>

        <p>Concerning suicides among sexual minority individuals, however, results appear to be inconclusive. It has been stated that there is no evidence for an increased risk for suicides among sexual minority individuals, mainly based on a limited number of psychological autopsy studies (Renaud, Berlim, Begolli, McGirr, & Turecki, <a href="#renaudberlimbegolli2010">2010</a>; Rich, Fowler, Young, & Blenkush, <a href="#richfowleryoung">1986</a>; Shaffer, Fisher, Hicks, Parides, & Gould, <a href="#shafferfischerhicks1995">1995</a>).1 Thus, the conclusions about suicides clearly contrast with the conclusions about suicide attempts. This contrast is surprising and paradoxical, given that a suicide attempt is the strongest risk factor for a future suicide (Harris & Barraclough, <a href="#harrisbarrac1997">1997</a>; Owens, Wood, Greenwood, Hughes, & Dennis, <a href="#owenswood2005">2005</a>).</p>

        <p>The article's objective is to clarify the discrepancy of results for suicides and suicide attempts in relation to sexual orientation by considering studies that differentiated the seriousness of suicide attempts, by reanalyzing the data from psychological autopsy studies, and by including studies with other methodological approaches. Several reviews have noted the discrepancy (e.g., Haas et al., <a href="#haas2011">2011</a>; McDaniel et al., <a href="#mcdanielpurcell2001">2001</a>; Muehrer, <a href="#muehrer1995">1995</a>), but we present additional arguments that are necessary to understand the seemingly paradoxical findings. Moreover, there are unique problems inherent in researching hidden populations that need to be taken into account for data interpretation. Finally, we discuss ethical concerns about the impact of suicide-related research findings on sexual minorities. Clarifying these issues is important given that the question "Are sexual minority individuals at increased risk for suicide?"has been answered in the literature with "yes,""no," and "not sure." As a result, sexual minority status has been deemed an important risk factor for suicide by some and doubted or ignored by others. Furthermore, mainstream youth and adult studies often lack sexual orientation information and sexual minorities have not always been acknowledged in suicide prevention programs. Our article explores and clarifies the weight of the evidence, how this evidence should be interpreted given the inherent methodological problems, and how the evidence may be translated into practice in light of ethical concerns.</p>

        <p>Evidence for Suicide Attempts</p>

        <p>As noted, numerous studies have reported elevated selfreported attempted suicide incidences among sexual minority individuals, compared with heterosexual counterparts, this being at odds with findings of seemingly not elevated suicides</p>

        <p>The discrepancy may be due to the caveats apparent in the studies about suicide attempts and sexual orientation, such as questionable representativeness of the study samples (e.g., from self-help groups), the lack of control groups, or definition problems for both suicide attempts and sexual orientation (Muehrer, 1995; Savin-Williams, 2001). However, these caveats dominating older studies have been overcome in many studies published since 1997. They feature improved methods such as using birth cohorts, twin registries, prospective designs, representative and large-scaled adolescent and adult surveys, matching lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals with their heterosexual siblings, and using multiple definitions of sexual orientation (Haas et al., <a href="#haas2011">2011</a>; King et al., <a href="#king2008">2008</a>; McDaniel et al., <a href="#mcdanielpurcell2001">2001</a>; Ploderl et al., <a href="#ploderlsauer2006">2006</a>; Russell, <a href="#russell2003">2003</a>).</p>

        <p>Another explanation for the discrepancy is that the attempted suicide data lacked validity due to problems associated with self-reports (Ploderl, Kralovec, Yazdi, &amp; Fartacek, <a href="#ploderlkralovecyazdi2011">2011</a>). It is known that, especially among adolescents, self-reported suicide attempts are often not "actual" suicide attempts or serious suicide attempts, these being "false positives" (Meehan, Lamb, Saltzman, &amp; O'Carroll, <a href="#meehanlambsaltz1992">1992</a>). This would only be problematic, however, if the validity of the self-reported suicide attempts varied by sexual orientation, as it was reported in only one but widely cited study (Savin-Williams, <a href="#savinwilliams2001">2001</a>), where the suicide attempt difference between heterosexual and LGB participants was no longer statistically significant after eliminating the false positives. Savin-Williams postulated that this may have been caused by sexual minority youth subscribing to a "suffering suicidal" script, i.e., sexual minority youth will exaggerate their reports of suicide attempts which were not serious because they assume that "suicide is a rite of passage for being young and gay"(Savin-Williams, <a href="#savinwilliams2001">2001</a>, p. 989).</p>

        <p>A closer look at this study, however, leads to a problem discussed in greater detail below: the lack of statistical power. Whereas it was true that, among the female sample, eliminating false positive suicide attempts decreased the sexual orientation difference substantially, the "true suicide attempts" difference approached statistical significance in the male sample: 2 % (1 of 61) among heterosexual males and 9 % (5 of 53) among sexual minority males attempted suicide, resulting in OR = 6.2, 95 % CI = 0.7-300.0, p = .095 (Fisher's exact test, two-sided, calculated from tabulated data in Ramsay &amp; Tremblay, <a href="#ramsaytremblay2012a">2012a</a>). The study, however, has a low observed power of 44 %; in other words,the risk for a Type II error(falsely rejecting the hypothesis of a non-zero difference) is 61 %. The appropriate sample size to achieve a power of 80 % with a = .05 in a two-sided Fisher test is n = 300 with 50 % sexual minority individuals (see below for calculationdetails).Therefore,the study's conclusions shouldbe qualified. Indeed, the results could be used to support the hypothesis that, among men, non-heterosexuals are at an increased risk for suicide attempts, even after using a more rigorous classification system of suicide attempts—an interpretation that contrasts with the interpretation of Savin-Williams. Two studies have directly applied Savin-Williams' method of separating true suicide attempts from false positives with follow up items, but did not replicate the findings, i.e., the sexual orientation differences remained comparable or even increased after eliminating false positive suicide attempts (Ploderl &amp; Fartacek, <a href="#ploderlfart2005">2005</a>; Ploderl et al., <a href="#ploderl2010">2010</a>)</p>

        <p>Several other questionnaire or interview-based studies that used more rigorous definitions of suicide attempts still found significantly increased suicide attempt rates among sexual minorities (Bagley &amp; Tremblay, <a href="#bagleytremblay1997">1997</a>; Ramsay &amp; Tremblay, <a href="#ramsaytremblay2012b">2012b</a>; Wichstrom &amp; Hegna, 2003). In addition, there are many large-scaled youth risk behavior surveys that assessed selfreported suicide attempts with and without medical treatment. In the majority of these studies, the sexual orientation differences in self-reported suicide attempt rates remained or even increased for more serious forms of suicide related behavior (Kann et al., <a href="#kann2011">2011</a>; Ramsay &amp; Tremblay, <a href="#ramsaytremblay2012b">2012b</a>). On the basis of a metaanalysis of mostly random adolescent surveys, Marshal et al. (2011) summarized the results: For sexual minorities, "[d]isparities increased with the increase in the severity of suicidality (ideation [OR = 1.96], intent/plans [OR = 2.20], suicide attempts [OR = 3.18], suicide attempts requiring medical attention [OR = 4.17]). Effects did not vary across gender, recruitment source, and sexual orientation definition"(p. 115). Suicide attempts requiring medical attention were classified as true suicide attempts by Savin-Williams (<a href="#savinwilliams2001">2001</a>) and these random survey results essentially refuted the suffering-script thes is based on low-count non-random study samples.</p>

        <p>The possible bias inherent in self-reported suicide attempts can also be estimated by comparing same-area results from questionnaire-based surveys with clinical interviews results known to produce much lower and more accurate "attempted suicide"estimates. In Chicago, studies with both methodologies have been available to compare yearly "attempted suicide" rates. For homosexually oriented adolescents, the interview-based Mustanski, Garofalo, and Emerson (<a href="#mustanskigarofaloeme2010">2010</a>) study compared with the Chicago 2003/2005 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys results (paper questionnaire) produced yearly attempted suicide rates of 6.5 % and 31.0 %, respectively, for an over-reporting factor of 5. When comparing results for all adolescents (about 95 % heterosexual), however, the over-reporting factor is 9: 1.3 % versus 11.8 % for yearly attempted suicide rates produced by the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods 2000-2002 (interviews) versus the Chicago 2003/2005 Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (paper questionnaire). This indicates that the over-reporting of self-reported attempted suicides in paper questionnaire is less for sexual minority youth, compared to heterosexual youth, thus suggesting the reverse of the suffering script thesis (for calculations and references, see Ramsay &amp; Tremblay, <a href="#ramsaytremblay2012a">2012a</a>).</p>

        <p>The"intent to die,"deemed the most important criterion to distinguish suicide attempts from other suicide related behavior (Silverman, Berman, Sanddal, O'Carroll, &amp; Joiner, <a href="#silvermanbermansanddal2007">2007</a>), has rarely been used in studies of the suicide risk of sexual minorities. The rare exceptions again found that using this definition resulted in significant sexual orientation differences (Bagley &amp; Tremblay, <a href="#bagleytremblay1997">1997</a>; D'Augelli et al., <a href="#daugelli2005">2005</a>; Ploderl et al., <a href="#ploderl2010">2010</a>).</p>

        <p>In summary, the hypothesis that self-reports about suicide attempts of sexual minority individuals are less valid than the heterosexual ones is not strongly supported by the available data. In fact, the sexual orientation differences hold true or even increase for the more serious forms of suicide attempts. Thus, if the sexual orientation differences remain significant for more serious forms of suicide attempts or even increase as reported in most adult studies and studies using data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveys, sexual orientation risk difference for suicides could be expected.</p>

        <p>Evidence for Suicides from Psychological Autopsy Studies</p>

        <p>Suicide attempts remain a controversial surrogate for suicides (Wortzel, Gutierrez, Homaifar, Breshears, &amp; Harwood, <a href="wortzelgutierrezhomai2010">2010</a>). Therefore,it is important to validate a risk or protective factor by testing the association between the factor and suicides. However, determining the association of suicide rates with sexual orientation is extremely challenging. From a statistical viewpoint, there is a"power struggle,"because both suicides and a sexual minority status are rare,thus requiring very large samples to obtain adequate statistical power. Unfortunately, sexual orientation variables are only rarely assessed in psychological autopsy studies and it isusually absentin coroners' assessments. In the few cases when sexual orientation has been assessed after a suicide via third parties (e.g., family member or close friends), the validity of this assessment is uncertain, because even close family members would often remain unaware of the sexual minority status of the deceased. This is especially apparent during the coming out period, where, on average, several years pass between the awareness of the sexual minority status and coming out to significant others (Fox, <a href="#fox1995">1995</a>). However, suicide risk likely peaks in this closeted period because of commonly experienced isolation and fearing the negative consequences of coming out (Cass, <a href="#cass1979">1979</a>; D'Augelli, Hershberger, &amp; Pilkington, <a href="#daugellihershpilki1998">1998, 2001</a>; Martin &amp; Hetrick, <a href="#martinhetrick1988">1988</a>; Meyer, <a href="#meyer2003">2003</a>; Radkowski &amp; Siegel, <a href="#radkoskysiegel1997">1997</a>). When interpreting psychological autopsy studies it is, therefore, important to take into account the likely underestimates for those with a non-heterosexual orientation.</p>

        <p>Psychological autopsy studies have used two analytic strategies to shed light on the association between sexual orientation and suicide. One strategy was to compare the proportion of sexual minority members in autopsy studies with a population base rate; the other strategy was to compare the proportion of sexual minority individuals who died by suicide with the proportion of sexual minority members of a matched living control group.</p>

        <p>Comparing the Proportion of Sexual Minority Members among Those Who Died by Suicide with the Proportion in the General Population</p>

        <p>An often cited study with this methodology is the psychological autopsy study of Rich et al. (<a href="#ricH<sub>1</sub>986">1986</a>), who classified 11 % of adult males who died by suicide in San Diego as homosexual, defined by predominantly or exclusively homosexual relationships or self-identification as homosexual. Rich et al. stated that this seems to be comparable to the base rate of homosexuality in the population, but also acknowledged that the true base rate is unknown. In recent representative population samples of the U.S., the proportion of self-identified homosexual individuals were reported to be considerably lower (men: 1.5-4.2 %; women: 0.9-1.8 %) (Chandra, Mosher, Copen, &amp; Sionean, <a href="#chandramoshercopen2011">2011</a>, Table 16). Thus, the 11 % reported in the Rich et al. (1986) study exceeds the base rate, an argument raised by McDaniel et al. (<a href="#mcdanielpurcell2001">2001</a>). On the other hand, lesbians were not detected among the female suicide victims,thus causing Rich et al. to speculate that being lesbian might be a protective factor for suicide. However, the base rate of homosexual males or females in the reference population of San Diego was unknown.</p>

        <p>In British Columbia, 81 children and youth died by suicide in the 2003-2007 five-year period (British Columbia Child Death Review Unit &amp; BC Coroner Service, <a href="#britishcolumcia2008">2008</a>). Of the 66 cases that were investigated with the psychological autopsy method, four (6.1 %) children and youth identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. There were also three children and youth who were judged to have been questioning their sexual orientation in the months prior to death. Adding these questioning children and youth to the total raises the percentage up to 10.6 %. Furthermore, there was insufficient information to determine the youth's sexual orientation in 16 cases. The 11 % estimate for gay, lesbian, bisexual, or questioning youth closely resembles the percentage reported in the Rich et al. study of adult males noted above. However, in contrast to the conclusion reached by Rich et al., the authors of the British Columbia report concluded that "gay, lesbian and bisexual children and youth, as well as those who were questioning their sexuality, were at increased risk of suicide" (p. vii). The conclusion was made with a comparison to demographic results from a province-wide population-based high school student survey, where only 2-4 % identified as gay, lesbian, or bisexual. Thus, similar results of two studies are deemed as supporting or contradicting evidence for an increased sexual minority suicide risk. Nonetheless, the conclusions of the BC study seem more plausible because it included all individualswho died by suicide in the province and the comparison was made with a base rate drawn from a representative sample from the same region, plus also taking into account the likely conservative estimation of group difference: there would be a larger underreporting bias in the autopsy study, compared with the control group based on anonymous self-reporting in the provincial survey.</p>

        <p>There are additional autopsy studies not mentioned in most reviews. One Austrian study investigated all police recorded suicides in the county of Salzburg between 1978 and 1979. About two percent (2.2 %, 2 of 90) males were classified as having been homosexual and none of 36 female counterparts (Mitterauer, <a href="#mitterauer1981">1981</a>). An Irish study (Irish Departments of Public Health, <a href="#irishdepartment2001">2001</a>) investigated 807 suicides between 1997 and 1998. Sexual orientation was not known in over one-third of cases, but was recorded for 502 deceased (102 women and 400 men). The percentage of nonheterosexually classified individuals was 3.2 %. Only one woman was classified as bisexual and none as homosexual; and 2.3 % (9 men) were bisexual and 1.5 % (6) were homosexual. In the Alaska Injury Prevention Center (<a href="#alaskainjury">2007</a>) study on 426 suicides between 2003 and 2006, the percentage of individuals who died by suicide and who were in a same-sex relationship was 4 %. Furthermore, 18 % had sexual relationship problems not further specified, which may have included sexual orientation problems. In a Swedish study of suicides in a defined region and time frame, 3 % (5 of 161) urban men and 1 % (1 of 110) rural men (2 % total) were classified as homosexual (Beskow, 1979). Finally, in a U.S.-military study of 212 suicides that occurred between 1985 and 1986, 2 % were deemed to have had a sexual deviation, likely including homosexuality (Rothberg, Fagan, &amp; Shaw, <a href="#rothbergfagan1990">1990</a>). Thus, it seems that the latter studies found a proportion of sexual minority individuals among those who died by suicide that is comparable with the proportion in the general population.</p>

        <p>As noted, psychological autopsy studies have important limitations, including the unknown base rate of sexual minority members, geographic variations of the proportion of sexual minority members, and non-disclosed sexual minority status. Also, the use of different dimensions of sexual orientation (sexual behavior, attraction, and self-identification) influences the base rate of homosexuality that is used for comparison (Ploderl et al., <a href="#ploderlsauer2006">2006</a>).</p>

        <p>Another problem is that population estimates for sexual minorities are based on self-reports of study participants who choose to disclose their sexual orientation to researchers whereas the determination of sexual orientation in autopsy studies is based on informants' speculations, inferences, and observations. Thus, the actual proportion of sexual minority individuals is likely underestimated in autopsy studies. Indeed, not one sexualminority individualwasidentified viainformants among two samples (Renaud et al., <a href="#renaud2010">2010</a>; Shaffer et al., <a href="#shaffer1995">1995</a>) of living adolescents (n = 147, n = 55, respectively). This differs from the rate of self identified homosexual or bisexual individuals in adult U.S.-population studies of about 3-8 % (Chandra et al., 2011, Table 16), about 2 % in the Canadian adult population (Bolton &amp; Sareen, <a href="#boltonsareen2011">2011</a>; Brennan, Ross, Dobinson, Veldhuizen, &amp; Steele, <a href="#brennanrossdob2010">2010</a>; Steele, Ross, Dobinson, Veldhuizen, &amp; Tinmouth, <a href="#steelerossdob2009">2009</a>), and around 5 % in representative school-based adolescent U.S.-samples (Kann et al., <a href="#kann2011">2011</a>; Reis &amp; Saewyc, <a href="#reis1999">1999</a>). Given the small sample sizes of the two autopsy studies, however, the underreporting bias can only be estimated with imprecision and future studies would be beneficial to quantify the bias.</p>

        <p>Comparing the Proportion of Sexual Minority Individuals in Those Who Died by Suicide with Their Proportion in a Living Control Group</p>

        <p>Assessing sexual orientation in psychological autopsy studies is problematic due to the likely underreporting bias. Nonetheless, the bias can be adjusted for by using the autopsy method (having one's sexual orientation determined by selected informants) for both a group of individuals who died by suicide and a living control group. To date, only two studies have used this methodology (Renaud et al., <a href="#renaud2010">2010</a>; Shaffer et al., <a href="#shaffer1995">1995</a>) and, given their importance, a detailed review and reanalysis is required.</p>

        <p>In Shaffer et al. (<a href="#shaffer1995">1995</a>), 120 adolescent under the age 20 year who died by suicide were compared with 147 matched living controls in the greater New York City metropolitan area. There were three individuals classified as homosexual among those who died by suicide and none among the controls. Shaffer et al. stated that "In spite of opportunity for biased reporting, it is concluded that this study finds no evidence that suicide is a common characteristic of gay youth" (p. 64) and that "…the data here suggest that the painful experience of establishing a gay orientation does not lead disproportionally to suicide" (p. 71). The more recent study by Renaud et al. (<a href="#renaud2010">2010</a>) compared 55 suicide victims from the province ofQuebec with 55 matched living controls, finding 4 individuals classified as having sexual minority status among the suicide group and none among the controls. Renaud et al. concluded that "In our sample, same-sex sexual orientation and gender identity issues do not appear to be more prevalent among youth who die by suicide, compared with youth recruited from the general population" (p. 29). Given the importance of these two studies, we will review and reanalyze them with alternative statistical methods.</p>

        <p><h2>Meta-analytic and Bayesian reanalysis of Shaffer et al. (<a href="#shaffer1995">1995</a>) and Renaud et al. (<a href="#renaud2010">2010</a>)</h2></p>

        <p>Significance Testing and Power Problems</p>

        <p>Using one-sided Fisher's Exact Tests for the data in the two studies, differences between the two groups were marginally statistically significant (p = .09 in Shaffer et al. and p = .06 in Renaud et al.). One male youth in the Shaffer et al. study committed suicide with a gay male youth and they were found dead holding hands, yet he was classified as heterosexual. Three additional males were described as having been teased because of effeminacy. If only one of the four cases had, in fact, been homosexually oriented, which is likely given the evidence, the group difference would then have been statistically significant (p = .04). Similarly, in Renaud et al., if only one additional individual had been classified as non-heterosexual, the difference would have become statistically significant (p = .03). Had these possible outcomes occurred, the study conclusions would have been the opposite; that is, sexual minority members are overrepresented among those dying by suicide. The counterintuitive finding that one additional case can change the overall outcome of a study is related tosignificance testing with low statistical power. Even assuming that there was no underreporting of sexual minority status and that the samples were representative of the population, the conclusions would be related to problematic interpretations of significance tests. This happens because "A non-significant result is no proof for the truth of the null hypothesis" (Bortz, <a href="#bortz1993">1993</a>, p. 114, translated by the first author); or "A p value indicates the evidence against the null hypothesis. It is not possible to observe the data and corroborate the null hypothesis; one can only fail to reject it"(Wagenmakers, <a href="#wagenmakers2007">2007</a>, p. 795).</p>

        <p>Problematic interpretations of significance test results can occur by not considering statistical power (probability that a test will yield significant results if there are differences), effect size (magnitude of the observed difference), and the berror (probability of falsely accepting the null hypothesis), which were not provided in the studies. The observed statistical power was low in both studies: 35 % in the Shaffer et al. and 37 % in the Renaud et al. studies, if the observed group differences are used as estimates of the population difference in one-sided Fisher exact tests (with a = .05 and sample sizes similar to that inthe two studies).Thepowerofthe two studies is thus much lower than the typically recommended power of 80 %. As a consequence, the risk of ab-error (Type II error) is high in these studies (63-65 %), because the b-error is directly related to statistical power (b = 1 - power). In this case, a Type II error means that one falsely concludes that the proportion of sexual minority members is similar among individuals dying by suicide and living controls. Rather, the correct conclusion from the results of the two studies is that the null-hypothesis (similar proportions of sexual minority member in both groups) was not rejected. In scientific inquiry, absence of evidence is not the same as evidence of absence; that is, the conclusion that the data support the nullhypothesis requires a consideration of power. Specifically, such conclusions are problematic because "in the case of unknown and probably low power, a non-significant result signifies that no conclusion should be drawn; that is, one should not affirm the null hypothesis with an uncontrolled error rate (beta error) and that the experiment probably was a waste of time and money" (Sedlmeier &amp; Gigerenzer, <a href="#sedlmeiergigerenzer1989">1989</a>, p. 312). Unfortunately, considering appropriate power has not substantially improved over the years in scientific publications (Balkin &amp; Sheperis, <a href="#balkinsheperis2011">2011</a>; Chan &amp; Altman, <a href="#chanaltman2005">2005</a>; Sedlmaier &amp; Gigerenzer, <a href="#sedlmeiergigerenzer1989">1989</a>).</p>

        <p>Null-hypothesis testing without considering statistical power and effect size can be misleading because even a small and clinically meaningless group difference becomes statistically significant with increasing sample size. Similarly, in the case of a very small effect it is no surprise that a study is underpowered. This would undermine the arguments above. Therefore, we will now consider the effect-sizes of the two autopsy studies. Odds ratios and risk ratios are direct measures of effect sizes, but due to empty cells in the control groups in the two studies, they cannot be calculated in the traditional way. A common strategy (continuity correction) is to add a constant to all cell entries (e.g., 0.5) to enable the calculationofodds-ratios(e.g., Sweeting, Sutton, &amp; Lambert, <a href="#sweetingsuttonlamb2004">2004</a>). With this strategy, substantial and clinical meaningful group differencesare produced forthe twostudies:OR = 8.79 (95 % CI = 0.45-171.82) in Shaffer et al. and OR = 9.70 (95 % CI = 0.51-184.63) in Renaud et al. However, the confidence intervals are wide due to the small samples and must be interpreted with caution.</p> 

        <p>Meta-Analysis</p>

        <p>Considerable resources are needed to conduct psychological autopsy studies with sufficient identifiable sexual minority individuals to generate the statistical power required for meaningful significance testing. By using meta-analysis to combine single studies that have insufficient statistical power, the "power-struggle" or lack of power in the two studies can be reduced. However, this is not without problems if there are zeros in the contingency tables because of possible biases resulting from continuity corrections: the addition of a small constant to all table cells (Subbiah &amp; Srinivasan, <a href="#subbiahsrini">2008</a>; Sweeting et al., <a href="#sweetingsuttonlamb2004">2004</a>). Tian et al. (<a href="#tian2009">2009</a>) developed an alternative meta-analytic approach without continuity corrections, thus avoiding biases and allowing for more valid inferences. With this procedure, the proportion differences of the Shaffer et al. and Renaud et al. studies in combination became statistically significant in two-sided tests (p\.05) except with the Fisher's test (p = .06) which is known to be unnecessarily conservative2,3 (see Fig. 1). Notably, the Tian et al. procedure is more conservative in comparison with the common continuity correction strategy3 and the Bayesian results that are presented in the next section.</p>

        <p>In summary, the meta-analytic combination of the two studies suggests that sexual minority members are overrepresented among individuals dying by suicide compared with living controls and this conclusion is at odds with the "nodifference" interpretation of the study authors.</p>

        <p>Bayesian Analysis</p>

        <p>Bayesian methods have become increasingly popular and recommended as an alternative to p value hypothesis testing (Kruschke, <a href="#Kruschke2011">2011</a>; Wagenmakers, <a href="wagenmakers2007">2007</a>). With Bayesian parameter estimation, researchers can directly quantify the uncertainty about a parameter of interest (in this case, the proportion difference of sexual minority members among those dying by suicide and living controls) and avoid relying on significance levels. Bayesian models capitalize on different forms of prior knowledge, which is entered in the model via prior distributions, making the results more plausible. This is particularly relevant in clinical studies where there are relatively few data points but extensive prior knowledge (for demonstrations of different prior distributions, see Kruschke, <a href="#Kruschke2011">2011</a>; Wagenmakers, <a href="#wagenmakers2007">2007</a>).</p>

        <p>Moreover, with Bayesian <em>hypothesis testing</em>, one can overcome problems of null-hypothesis significance testing. Specifically, the so called Bayes Factor (henceforth BF<sub>10</sub>) can be used to quantify how many times more likely the observed data would have occurred under the alternative hypothesis H<sub>1</sub> versus the null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub> (Jeffreys, <a href="#jeffreys1961">1961</a>; Kass &amp; Raftery, <a href="#kassraft1995">1995</a>; Wagenmakers, <a href="#wagenmakers2007">2007</a>; Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom, &amp; van der Maas, <a href="#wagenwetzelborsmaas2011">2011</a>). With an ordinal classification schema ranging from "anecdotal" to "extreme," the BF<sub>10</sub> can then be categorized to express how strong the data support one hypothesis over the other (e.g., Jeffreys, <a href="#jeffreys1961">1961</a>; Wagenmakers et al., <a href="#wagenwetzelborsmaas2011">2011</a>, Table 1). A BF<sub>10</sub> ranging between 1 and 3 can be interpreted as anecdotal evidence in favor of H<sub>1</sub> (nonzero group difference), from 3 to 10 as substantial evidence in favor of H<sub>1</sub>. A BF<sub>10</sub> between 0.33 and 1 can be interpreted as anecdotal evidence in favor of H<sub>0</sub> (zero group difference), from 0.10 to 0.33 as substantial evidence in favor of H<sub>0</sub>.</p>

        <p><em>Bayesian Methodology</em></p>

        <p>We used WinBUGS Version 1.4.3 (Lunn, Thomas, Best, &amp; Spiegelhalter, <a href="#lunnthomasbest2000">2000</a>) in combination with R Version 2.12.1 (R Development Core Team, <a href="#rdevelopment2010">2010</a>) and the necessary packages (R2WinBUGS, polspline) for the Bayesian analysis.3 For the calculation of the differences of two binomials and the BF<sub>10</sub>, we used the procedure suggested by Lee and Wagenmakers (2010, Chapter 16.1). Power calculations were made with G*Power Version 3.1.2 (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &amp; Buchner, <a href="#faulerdlang2007">2007</a>)</p>

        <p><em>Bayesian Results</em></p>

        <p><em>Parameter estimation</em>: Combining the results of the two studies resulted in a Bayesian 95 % credible interval of the proportion differenceDelta = 0.01-0.08(M = 0.04).This means that given the data, the proportion difference lies between 1 % and 8 % with a probability of .95; this positive difference is consistent with the notion that, compared with living controls, sexual minority members are overrepresented among individuals dying by suicide (Figs. 1, 2, Table 1) and that the Bayesian results are at odds with a"no-difference"interpretation. The Bayesian results for the individual studies are suggestive but not as strong as the results for the combined studies.</p>

        <p><em>Bayesian hypothesis testing</em>: The BF<sub>10</sub> of the two combined studies suggest substantial evidence in favor of H<sub>1</sub> (more sexual minority members among individuals dying by suicide compared with living controls) over H<sub>0</sub> (no difference) for one-sided and two-sided Bayesian hypothesis tests (Table 1). Even with the uninformative, implausible prior distribution, there is anecdotal strength.</p>

        <p>In summary, the Bayesian parameter estimation for both studies indicates that sexual minority members are overrepresented among individuals dying by suicide compared with living controls and the Bayesian Hypothesis test reveals that this evidence is substantial.</p>

        <p>The Shaffer et al. and Renaud et al. studies are important because their design controlled for the underreporting bias apparent in other psychological autopsy studies. However, as we have demonstrated, the original interpretations and conclusions in these studies are problematic, given the lack of statistical power, the near statistically significant results reported in the studies, the inherent high risk for incorrectly accepting the "no difference" hypothesis (b-error), and the statistically significant and clinically meaningful results occurring after the meta-analytical or Bayesian combination of studies. In stark contrast to the original study interpretations, the reanalysis of the two very important autopsy suicides does point to a statistical and clinically meaningful increased suicide risk among sexual minority individuals.</p>

        <p><h2>Evidence for Suicides From Other Studies</h2></p>

        <p>Other methodological approaches have also been used to examine the association between suicide rates and sexual orientation. An elevated risk for suicides was reported by a Danish study that used national registers and thus overcame self-report problems (Qin, Agerbo, &amp; Mortensen, <a href="#qin2003">2003</a>). In this study, individuals in registered same-sex partnerships had an approximately three-fold increased risk for having died by suicide compared with individuals in heterosexual marriages. A recent update of this study with a longer study period and separate analysis by gender revealed an eight-fold statistically significant increased suicide risk among sexual minority males and a 1.5 fold, statistically non-significant risk for sexual minority women (Mathy, Cochran, Olson, &amp; Mays, <a href="#mathycochran2009">2009</a>). Riggle, Rostosky, and Horne (<a href="rigglerosto2010">2010</a>) reported that sexual minority members in legally recognized partnerships were the most psychologically well-adjusted, followed by those in non-registered committed partnership, those in dating relationships, and single participants. This finding, when considered with evidence that Denmark is one of the countries with the most positive attitudes towards gay men and lesbians (European Commission, <a href="#europeancommission2008">2008</a>, p. 57), makes it possible that the relative suicide risk among the overall nonDanish sexual minority members is higher in adulthood, in addition to the likely elevated adolescent suicide risk.</p>

        <p>In a recent U.S. prospective study with a large male sample that also assessed homosexual behavior (Cochran &amp; Mays, <a href="#cochranmays2011">2011</a>), no participant who reported having had sex with men (n = 85) was found to have died of suicide in the study period compared with 18 (0.3 %) men who reported having had sex with women only (n = 5,292). With an eightfold increase of risk as in the Danish study, one would expect to find about one male who died by suicide in the sexual minority group as assumed by Cochran and Mays. An inspection of the Bayesian posterior distribution of the proportion difference suggests that the posterior distribution peaks around the zero difference (M = 0.01) with a substantial credible interval (0.00-0.04), which is understandable given the low statistical power of the study. To detectanhypothetical8-foldincreaseofsuiciderisk(as reported in the Danish study) with a one-sided Fisher test, given the observed 0.3 % suicides among heterosexuals and 0.3 9 8 = 2.4 % suicides in the sexual minority group and the observed proportion of sexual minority members (85 of 5292),a sample of about 10,000 participants is required (with about 160 sexual minority members) to achieve a power of 80 %. The given sample has a power of 57 % to detect such an effect; in other words, the risk of making a Type II error is b = .43. The conclusionofCochranandMaysthat"mortalityriskfromnon-HIVrelated causes, including suicide, was not elevated among MSM"(p. e4) is thus problematic, due to low statistical power. The expected proportion difference (2.4-0.3 % = 2.1 % or 0.021) actually lies in the central part of the credible interval of the Bayesian posterior distribution, leading to the conclusion that the results of Cochran and Mays (<a href="#cochranmays2011">2011</a>) are definitely not in "stark  contradiction," as highlighted by Haas et al. (<a href="#haas2011">2011</a>, p. 17).</p>

        <p>Finally, there are studies of suicide risk among psychiatric patients that should be mentioned for completeness, noting that psychiatric patients are not representative of the general sexual minority population. Nonetheless, having a homosexual or bisexual orientation was one of the strongest predictor for future suicides among psychiatric patients (Martin, Cloninger, Guze, &amp; Clayton, <a href="#martincloninger1985">1985</a>; Motto, Heilbron, &amp; Juster, <a href="#mottoheiljuster1985">1985</a>) and was overrepresented among near-lethal suicides (Weyrauch, Roy-Byrne, Katon, &amp; Wilson, <a href="#weyrauchroy2001">2001</a>) and suicide attempters with resulting severe spinal cord injuries (Lombardi, Mondaini, Iazzetta, Macchiarella, &amp; Del Popolo, <a href="#lombardimondaine2008">2008</a>). Although these studies are rarely cited, they are nonetheless important to consider in a clinical context. Similarly, in nonclinical population based studies, a sexual minority status turned out to be one of the strongest predictors of suicide attempts within a range of other risk factors (Gratz, <a href="#gratz2006">2006</a>; Jiang, Perry, &amp; Hesser, <a href="#jiang2010">2010</a>; Kisch, Leino, &amp; Silverman, <a href="#kischleino2005">2005</a>; O'Connor, Rasmussen, &amp; Miles, <a href="#oconnorrasmussen2009">2009</a>; Olshen et al., <a href="#olshen2007">2007</a>; Whitlock &amp; Knox, <a href="#whitlockknox2007">2007</a>; Wichstrom, <a href="#wichstrom2009">2009</a>)</p>

        <p><h2>Limitations Inherent in Research on Sexual Minorities</h2></p>

        <p>Older studies reporting on the association of sexual orientation and suicide risk have been criticized for methodological reasons, particularly sampling issues and the assessment of sexual orientation and suicide attempts. More recent studies overcame most of these problems by using more varied definitions of sexual orientations, random samples, and more rigorous definitions of suicide attempts. However, some problems may never be overcome. For example, nonresponse bias is a problem that became apparent in one study: three times (16.8 vs. 5.1 %) more men who had sex with men were among those who initially refused to participate in a household survey (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href="#centersdiseasecontrol1991">1991</a>), with  he prevalence of suicide attempts remaining unknown among these individuals. Fewer sexual minority members disclose their homosexual behavior to interviewers compared with computer based methods (Villaroel et al., <a href="#villaroel2006">2006</a>). Thus, in many studies, non-disclosed sexual minority individuals would be incorrectly classified as heterosexual. It is possible that non-disclosed sexualminority individuals or those who refuse study participation may be at increased risk for suicide, a reasonable hypothesis given the negative psychological impact of a concealed stigma (Pachankis, <a href="#pachankis2007">2007</a>). On the other hand, those who report their sexual orientation may also be more willing to report suiciderelated thoughts and behaviors than those not disclosing their sexual orientation, leading to an inflated estimation of suicide risk. In addition, the study of rather rare events, such as suicides and serious suicide attempts, combined with a sexual minority orientation require very large samples to achieve sufficient statistical power. Many researchers therefore collapse sexual minority subgroups into one category (e.g., homosexual, bisexual, mostly heterosexual, questioning, transgender individuals), which has been criticized because there may be notable differences in mental health problems between these groups (Savin-Williams, <a href="#savinwilliams2008">2008</a>). With subgroups, however, the  major problem remains as to where one draws the line between a heterosexual or non-heterosexual orientation (McCabe, Hughes, Bostwick, Morales, &amp; Boyd, <a href="#mccabeshughesbost2012">2012</a>; Ploderl et al., <a href="#ploderl2010">2010</a>). For these and other reasons, it has been suggested that there is no sampling design which canovercome all of these problems (Meyer &amp; Wilson, <a href="#meyerwilson2009">2009</a>). At best, we can speculate about the direction of possible biases and more research on the biases is required.</p>

        <p>Therefore, it is useful to validate the results with multimethod approaches (e.g., by sampling from the general population and also from sexual minority communities). In the future, it is hoped that national surveys, such as CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Survey, will routinely include sexual orientation measures. If convenience samples include many individuals from self-help groups or counseling groups, the results may overestimate suicide attempt rates (Savin-Williams &amp; Ream, <a href="#savinwilliams2003">2003</a>). But this may not be a problem for conveniences amples in general, because a meta-analytic review of probability and convenience samples reported similar results or even smaller risk differences for convenience samples (Meyer, <a href="#meyer2003">2003</a>, Fig. 3). The most exhaustive collation of published and unpublished international studies on the association of suicide attempts and sexual orientation with different methodologies has produced a very consistent picture: nearly all studies found increased incidences of self-reported suicide attempts among sexual minorities (Ramsay &amp; Tremblay, <a href="#ramsaytremblay2012a">2012a</a>).</p>

        <p>For the association of suicide and sexual orientation, methodological problems are even more difficult to overcome, as discussed above, including the following problem reported by Dorais and Lajeunesse (<a href="#dorais2004">2004</a>):"Second scenario [for some gay male suicide attempters studied]: Instead of revealing his homosexuality, the young male attempts suicide so that he will take his secret with him and hide forever the desires perceived to be so shameful. 'If my attempt to kill myself had succeeded, no one would have ever known that it was because of my homosexual orientation. My parents would have blamed it on family problems and on the break-up with my girlfriend" (pp. 40-41). Hopefully, future psychological autopsy studies will routinely assess sexual orientation, so that our knowledge and understanding is improved and for inclusion in meta-analyses. Studies could also be designed to estimate the underreporting bias (e.g., by using the psychological autopsy method determining their sexual orientation via informants) when studying severe suicide attempts and comparing results with suicide attempter self-reports. This will require resources and time; however, despite increased methodological efforts, biases cannot be ruled out, but only incrementally reduced.</p>

        <p>Those who seek to translate research into practice must face the critical question concerning what to do with evidence that is inconclusive because of the inherent methodological problems and such studies may even be classified as low quality, as done by the Australian Government Department of Health and Ageing (<a href="#australian2008">2008</a>). In their review, it was concluded that "based upon results of (scarce) studies conducted to date, suicide rates do not appear to be increased among the gay and lesbian populations" (p. 67). We think it is  mportant to be aware that, in certain fields, such as in sexual minority research, for the many reasons noted in this article, the evidence cannot reach top quality status. We nonetheless believe that if incontrovertible evidence is lacking, the available evidence should be judiciously evaluated when a particular group may be at heightened risk. This is an ethical position explored in the next section. Perhaps the inherent methodological problems are the reason why sexual minority issues are completely lacking even in a recent major suicide textbook (Wasserman &amp; Wasserman,<a href="#wasserman2009">2009</a>), orthatonly methodological problems were discussed, without considering the mass of studies that indicate an increased suicide risk (Miller &amp; Eckert, <a href="#millereckert2009">2009</a>). As we have demonstrated above, improved evaluation of the data leads to the conclusion that sexual orientation is likely a risk factor for suicide.</p>

        <p><h2>Ethical Issues</h2></p>

        <p>What are the costs of falsely concluding that sexual minority individualshaveahigherriskforsuicide?Perhapsthiswillresult in sexual minority individuals being stigmatized and this may even contribute to a suffering script (Savin-Williams, <a href="#savinwilliams2001">2001</a>) which could leadLGB youth tobelieve thatitis the normto beat risk for suicide, a concern for which there is no credible evidence. Of note, most sexual minority individuals do not attempt or even die by suicide; despite the increased risk (we thank one anonymous reviewer that we should not forget to stress this). Suicide is also not the norm even in the well known high-risk groups such as severely depressed patients or individuals who already attempted suicide.</p>

        <p>An additional cost of falsely attributing suicide risk to a specific group may be that limited and valuable resources in suicide prevention are wasted. On the other hand, falsely assuming that sexual orientation is not an important suicide risk factor may lead to inattention to a very serious mental health issue for which there is supporting evidence. This can produce silence in textbooks and therefore not having suicide prevention efforts directed at a higher risk group, a tragically costly situation referred to by Haas et al. (<a href="#haas2011">2011</a>): "The consistency of the data pointing to elevated risk of suicide and mental health problems among sexual minority people argues for taking action now rather than awaiting more research evidence"(p. 23). It should be noted that suicide prevention programs for sexual minorities are still not evidence-based and that studies are required to show that evidence-based suicide prevention programs are also effective for sexual minorities.</p>

        <p>Unfortunately, the arguments quickly go beyond the data into ethics or politics. It has been suggested, for example, that research about the elevated suicide risk among sexual minorities is used to garner resources (Savin-Williams, <a href="#savinwilliams2008">2008</a>) or as evidence for the pathological nature of homosexuality (e.g., Whitehead, <a href="#whitehead2009">2009</a>). However, we are not aware of a serious discussion of the costs of false conclusions, such as untreated psychological distress or even prevented suicides.</p>

        <p>Furthermore, considering the risks and costs of falsely assuming an increased suicide risk (or the absence of an increased risk) among a certain population is important for planning future studies and related significance tests. The Neyman-Pearson approach explicitly addressed the issue of carefully balancing a-levels and b-levels to quantify the risk of making aTypeIerror,in this case falsely assuming that there is a sexual orientation difference of suicide risk; and a Type II error (falsely assuming that there is no sexual orientation difference of suicide risk). Only with adequate statistical power, Type I and Type II errors can be controlled. Thus, ethical concerns can enter into the statistical level. We have shown that critical studies on suicides focused mostly on the Type I error and largely ignored possible Type II errors. Our analyses strongly suggest that the risk of a Type II error (erroneously concluding that there is no sexual orientation risk difference) was high in the methodologically most important psychological autopsy studies (Renaud et al., <a href="#renaud2010">2010</a>; Shaffer et al., <a href="#shaffer1995">1995</a>).</p>

        <p>We did not discuss the reasons for the increased suicide problem among sexual minorities. Current scientific models point to the damaging effects of sexual minority stress (Hatzenbuehler, <a href="#hatzenbuehler2009">2009</a>; Hong, Espelage, &amp; Krall, <a href="#hongespelagekrall2011">2011</a>; Meyer, <a href="#meyer2003">2003</a>). For example, the minority stress model of Meyer (<a href="#meyer2003">2003</a>) conceptualizes that, in addition to general stressors, minority specific stressors cause mental health problems. Such stressors include distal minority stress, for example actual discrimination and violence; and proximal stressors, such as hiding one's sexual minority status, fear of coming out, or devaluating one's sexual orientation (internalized homophobia). The negative impact of these stressors can be buffered by social support and by coping abilities and are influenced by contextual factors, such as prominence, valence or integration of the minority status. Besides stressors that are explicitly related to a sexual minority status, it turned out that childhood gender nonconformity is a factor that increases suicide risk even before coming out (e.g., Ploderl &amp; Fartacek, <a href="#ploderl2009">2009</a>). Finally, HIV is both associated with suicide risk and, among men, sexual minority status (Catalan et al., <a href="#catalan2011">2011</a>). More research is needed to explore how much of the suicide risk may be attributable to HIV among non-heterosexual men. The risk for HIV and for suicide are likely related through common factors (e.g., internalized homophobia) that are involved both in the development of mental health problems and in risky sexual behavior (Newcomb &amp; Mustanski, <a href="#newcombmust2010">2010, 2011</a>).</p>

        <p>Minority stressors have been associated with mental health problems, including suicidality, not only among sexual minority individuals but also among heterosexual individuals assumed to be homosexual and targeted for related harassmentand abuses (Murphy, 2007;Reis&amp;Saewyc,1999, Table 4). Future studies may, therefore, benefit from a focus on all who experience sexual minority stress, independent of one's sexual self-identity (Tremblay &amp; Ramsay, 2000). For a related reanalysis of the Shaffer et al. and Renaud et al. studies, see Tremblay, Ploderl, and Ramsay (2012).</p>

        <p>Minority stress models can explain mental health problems among sexual minorities in general; however, it has still to be investigated why some sexual minority individuals specifically develop suicide risk. Therefore, it is necessary to simultaneously apply both established suicide models and minority stress models in future research.</p>

        <p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p>

        <p>Given the evidence presented, sexual minority individuals are at greater risk for suicides and suicide attempts, compared to their heterosexual counterparts. We demonstrated that the  often noted discrepancy between sexual minority suicide (no risk difference) and suicide attempt (apparent risk difference) stemmed from questionable interpretations of psychological autopsy studies. For the two adolescent autopsy studies which are most important due to their case-control design, the discrepancy was caused by interpretations (no greater risk for sexual minorities) based on problematic understanding of statistical significance tests, interpretations that should be reversed given the results from alternative statistical procedures, such as more powerful tests, Bayesian statistics, and meta-analysis.</p>

        <p>In addition, we discussed the challenge of interpreting sexual minority suicide research because of past methodological problems that have been greatly reduced in the past 15 years. It was also important to elaborate on the ethical dilemma involved when translating inherently imperfect research into suicide prevention practice. Our closer look at the existing suicide data, combined with the results of published meta-analyses and review papers, leads to the conclusion that, because sexual minorities are at risk for suicide and suicide attempts, there should be an ethical suicide prevention imperative to target sexual minorities</p>
