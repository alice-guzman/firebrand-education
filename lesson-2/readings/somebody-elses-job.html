        <p style="margin-top: 0;"><strong>Abstract</strong> Sexuality is an aspect of health and development that is often overlooked among people with physical disabilities, particularly adolescents. Studies have demonstrated that youth with physical disabilities show considerably lower levels of sexual knowledge and receive inadequate sex education compared to their peers without such disabilities. The data for this paper are part of a qualitative study that explored the experiences, barriers and challenges associated with sex education for youth with physical disabilities from the perspectives of young people themselves, their parents and the health professionals who work with them. The findings from this study highlight the tendency for parents, educators and health professionals to place the responsibility of delivering sex education to young people with physical disabilities on someone else who they believe to be more appropriately qualified to handle these types of situations. As a result, the findings illustrate that adolescents with physical disabilities do not always receive the necessary combination of comprehensive sex education within school environments, specialized information from health professionals, and informal sex education from family and peers that they require in order to gain the knowledge and skills needed to understand their own sexual capabilities and make informed decisions about their sexual health and intimate relationships.</p>

        <p><h2>Introduction</h2></p>

        <p>Sexuality is an aspect of health and development that is often overlooked among persons with physical disabilities, particularly adolescents. Studies have shown that youth with physical disabilities show considerably lower levels of sexual knowledge and receive inadequate sex education compared to their peers without such disabilities [<a href="#ref1">1</a>]. This lack of sex education is generally attributed to societal misconceptions about people with disabilities as being innocent, naïve and asexual [<a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>]. Research also indicates that parents, educators and health professionals often feel uncomfortable or ill equipped to discuss issues of sexuality with youth who have physical disabilities due to a lack of resources coupled with widespread societal stigma surrounding sexuality and disability [<a href="#ref3">3–5</a>]. The issue of low sexual knowledge combined with factors such as dependence on adults for personal care, social isolation, and low self-esteem can put adolescents with physical disabilities at high risk for sexual abuse, sexually transmitted infections, and unplanned pregnancy [<a href="#ref6">6</a>]. The current gaps in adolescent sexuality and disability literature relate to youth living with physical limitations, as well as descriptive, qualitative information, since the majority of the research that is available in this area is largely outdated, quantitatively based and generally focused on adolescents with cognitive disabilities. Gaining a better understanding of the development and challenges surrounding sexuality and sex education among adolescents with physical disabilities is an important step to improving the overall physical, emotional and social wellbeing of this often misunderstood and stigmatized population.</p>

        <p>This research study used in-depth narrative interviews and focus groups with youth who have physical disabilities, parents and health professionals in order to understand what learning about sexuality is like for adolescents living with a physical disability, and how this experience influences the way they view themselves as sexual beings. An additional aim of this study was to better understand the barriers and challenges faced by parents, educators and health professionals when providing sex education information to these youth, in order to create the necessary resources and services needed to help develop sex education and knowledge for youth with physical disabilities. The themes explored in this paper include sex education resources and services available to youth with physical disabilities, support and training for educators and health professionals and the barriers, challenges and intergroup conflict faced by youth, parents and health workers in delivering and receiving appropriate sexuality education and counselling.</p>

        <p><h2>Literature Review</h2></p>

        <p>Although having a physical disability may cause impairments and limitations to a person's physical functioning, it does not necessarily affect one's basic physiological and sexual drives or one’s desire for love, intimacy, and affection [<a href="#ref7">7</a>]. However, due to their potential for functional difficulties, young people with physical disabilities are often viewed as naïve, vulnerable and in need of protection and are not always provided with adequate information related to their own sexuality and sexual health [<a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref5">5</a>]. Therefore, when information or education pertaining to sex is provided, parents, educators, and health professionals tend to emphasize safety and sexual abuse prevention while often disregarding aspects of healthy sexual development such as the importance of touch, intimacy, relationships, and sexual exploration [<a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>]. Despite Canadian government agencies affirming the importance of sexual health education to the overall health and wellbeing of the entire population, sexuality and disability is an aspect of health and development that is often overlooked among young people with physical disabilities in both formal and informal educational settings [<a href="#ref9">9</a>].</p>

        <p>A common misconception about people with physical disabilities is that they are incapable of or uninterested in any form of sexual expression. While these associations between disability and asexuality are prevalent within society, several studies have found that the rates of sexual activity among adolescents with mild to moderate physical disabilities are equal to that of their able bodied counterparts [<a href="#ref5">5</a>, <a href="#ref10">10</a>], and in some cases may even be higher [<a href="#ref11">11</a>, <a href="#ref12">12</a>]. However, the widespread stigma and lack of appropriate resources related to sexuality and disability for these youth often combine to make parents and caregivers feel uncomfortable or ill equipped to discuss issues related to sexuality if and when they do arise [<a href="#ref1">1</a>]. This lack of communication can result in negative implications for these youth, such as lower self-esteem, sexual identity confusion and doubt regarding their status as a sexual being [<a href="#ref7">7</a>, <a href="#ref13">13</a>].</p>

        <p>Along with parents and caregivers, health professionals are another group who often find it challenging to address sexuality issues with adolescents who have physical disabilities, particularly in a healthcare or rehabilitation environment. The reasons why health professionals may have a difficult time discussing sexuality issues with these youth include a lack of disability specific knowledge, limited time during appointments, personal discomfort related to sexuality, inadequate training on the subject, or the fear of negative reactions from parents and colleagues [<a href="#ref2">2</a>, <a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref14">14</a>]. A recent Dutch study found that 90 % of youth with Cerebral Palsy did not receive any sexuality information from their health care providers [<a href="#ref15">15</a>]. Wiegerink et al. [<a href="#ref15">15</a>] explain that since youth with physical disabilities are often uncomfortable bringing up sexuality issues during a medical or rehabilitation appointment, it is the responsibility of the health professional to bring up this topic with their young clients. However, research indicates that discussions about sexuality and sexual health rarely occur between health professionals and youth with physical disabilities within a pediatric rehabilitation setting, causing many of these adolescents to remain largely unaware of the implications that their disability has on their own sexual functioning and reproductive capacity [<a href="#ref3">3</a>, <a href="#ref16">16</a>].</p>

        <p>The information currently available on the topic of sexuality and sex education among adolescents with physical disabilities is rather limited and outdated with specific gaps in the research pertaining to sex education from a Canadian context, as well as studies involving several different members of the disability community. The majority of the adolescent sexuality and disability research that is available tends to be focused on sex education for youth who have developmental delays or other types of cognitive impairments due to a fear of sexual abuse and exploitation [<a href="#ref1">1</a>, <a href="#ref8">8</a>], while often disregarding the youth who have physical disabilities that do not affect their cognitive functioning, such as the youth participants of this study. Additionally, most of the research into adolescent sexuality and disability uses quantitative methodologies, therefore failing to capture the personal experience and subjective perceptions of learning about sexuality which can only be fully explored through qualitative means. The present study addresses these important gaps in the current literature and demonstrates the importance of understanding the sexual health needs of youth with physical disabilities, who need improvements in the sex education that they receive in order to be viewed as deserving and fully capable sexual beings within society.</p>

        <p>In order to understand the issues and challenges facing adolescents who have physical disabilities with regard to sexuality and sex education, it is important to explore the underlying theoretical frameworks upon which our current understandings of disability and sexuality are based on. The theoretical perspectives that provide the framework for this study are the social model of disability, Goffman's notion of stigma and the theory of sexual citizenship.</p>

        <p>Until fairly recently, research and discourse related to disability had been dominated by the western biomedical model. This perspective proposes a dichotomy between what is considered "normal" versus "pathological", where someone with a disability is seen as inherently damaged, flawed, and in need of repair because they do not represent the culturally accepted ideals of how a body should look and function [<a href="#ref17">17</a>]. As the rights of marginalized populations became increasingly recognized during the social and political movements of the 1960 and 1970, a new way of thinking about disability, known as the social model or social constructionist theory, began to gain recognition. This model, rooted in the idea that dominant groups in society set the rules that define normality and deviance, frames disability as a public or social issue rather than a matter of individual deficits and corporeal shortcomings [<a href="#ref18">18</a>]. The social model of disability places an emphasis on how the environment, both physical and socio-political, includes or excludes certain people from fully participating in society [<a href="#ref19">19</a>]. The social model of disability was included in this study as a means of understanding the way disability is currently viewed within society, how this model has changed the notion of disability over time and what sort of impact this model has had on the inclusion, acceptance and quality of life for people living with physical disabilities.</p>

        <p>The presence of disability-related stigma within society is an issue that is discussed several times throughout this study, as it poses a significant barrier towards people with disabilities being viewed and respected as sexual beings. In order to eliminate this negative stigma from society, it must first be understood what stigma is, why it exists, how it develops, and what type of impact it can have on the people it affects. It is for this reason that Goffman’s notion of stigma was chosen as the second theoretical framework for this study. Stigma is defined as "a mark of disgrace associated with a particular circumstance, quality, or person" [<a href="#ref20">20</a>], a term that was first coined by sociologist Erving Goffman [<a href="#ref21">21</a>] in 1963 to describe any person who, due to some form of physical or social deviation from the culturally defined norm, was considered to be undesirable, unworthy and an outcast. While the concept of stigma operates within and is perpetuated against many groups in society, it has a particular relevance to the treatment and perception of people who have physical, cognitive or sensory impairments. Researchers explain that societal stigma is common towards people with disabilities due to the numerous misconceptions and assumptions that are presently associated with this population [<a href="#ref22">22</a>, <a href="#ref23">23</a>]. Some experts believe that the stigma associated with "non-normative bodies" also stems from the knowledge, fear and resentment that anyone can become disabled at any point in time. This negative societal attitude towards disability can lead to discrimination and marginalization, by creating a stereotyped view of anyone with a physical limitation or difference as being perceived to be incapable, dependent and thus discredited from mainstream society [<a href="#ref24">24</a>].</p>

        <p>The final theory used as a framework for this study relates to sexual citizenship, a theory that has significant relevance to several different minority groups, such as members of the LGBTQ community, as well as those living with physical disabilities. Although it can be difficult to label a group as a minority without reverting to an 'othering' type of mentality, it is also important to recognize that some groups within society have specific needs and challenges in terms of the intimate relationships they pursue and the sexual health information and services they require. Sexual citizenship encompasses three dimensions; first, a demand for control, such as control over one's body, emotions and relationships; second, a demand for access, including access to representations, information, services, partners and public spaces; and third, a demand for choice, particularly regarding identity, lifestyle and gender experience [<a href="#ref25">25</a>]. For people with physical disabilities, their specific demands, needs and challenges must be identified in order to ensure that they are viewed as sexual citizens within society. This means having an equal opportunity to receive accessible and relevant sexual health information and services, which is considered by the World Health Organization [<a href="#ref26">26</a>] to be a basic human right for all people. The theory of sexual citizenship was included in this study as a means of understanding why it is that people with physical disabilities are not always viewed as being equally entitled to the same sexual rights and choices as the rest of able bodied society, and what kind of influence does sexual citizenship, or a lack thereof, have on a person's sexual health, sexual knowledge and overall sense of self.</p>

        <p><h2>Methodology</h2></p>

        <p>A qualitative constructivist approach was used in this study. Unlike positivist orientations to research and epistemology which work from the position that the only 'real' or authoritative knowledge is that which is observed or created through 'science' [<a href="#ref27">27</a>], constructivists contend that multiple, constructed realities exist, and research informed through this lens encourage the co-construction of meaning through open, 'back and forth' dialogue between the participant and the researcher [<a href="#ref28">28</a>, <a href="#ref29">29</a>]. The researchers were able to use this particular paradigm to help guide them through the research process by allowing the co-constructed knowledge that was gained through interactional dialogue between the participants and researchers to be fully expressed, integrated and valued throughout the entire study. Narrative inquiry was selected as the primary mode of data collection because it is particularly useful in research with those who may be misunderstood by society or at risk of marginalization, such as people living with physical disabilities. This is due in part to the open-ended, intimate and respectful approach taken by researchers within a qualitative inquiry, as well as the fact that narrative inquiry focuses specifically on the uniqueness of each individual and their experiences, rather than being concerned with making generalizations about the entire population [<a href="#ref30">30</a>, <a href="#ref31">31</a>] Table <a href="#table1">1</a>.</p>

        <p>Semi-structured narrative interviews were conducted with the youth and parents in order to gain in-depth understandings of their lives and experiences [<a href="#ref32">32</a>]. The inclusion criteria for the youth required that the participants must be between the ages of 14 and 21 and have a physical disability that requires the use of a mobility device such as a wheelchair. The exclusion criteria for this study related to adolescents with additional cognitive or developmental disabilities. In total, four youth between the ages of 15 and 20 participated in two interviews each during the study. All of the interviews were held in the participant's homes with the exception of one which was held in a conference room at a library. The youth consisted of three females, two of whom had Cerebral Palsy and one who had Spina Bifida and one male who had Spina Bifida. Four parents participated in one interview each during the study, including three mothers and one father. Their children ranged in age from 18 to 21, and had a variety of different disabilities including Spina Bifida, Muscular Dystrophy, Cerebral Palsy and other neurological disorders. For detailed demographic information of the narrative interview participants refer to Appendix—Table <a href="#table2">2</a>.</p>

        <p>Along with the narrative interviews conducted with youth and parents, there was also a focus group conducted with health professionals who work with adolescents who have physical disabilities and their families. Four health professionals from a regional children's rehabilitation centre (CRC) participated in the 90 min focus group which took place in a conference room at the CRC. This group consisted of an occupational therapist, a teacher who also worked as a counselor, a nurse and a social worker. The group was made up of an equal number of male and female participants. All of the participants were recruited through a variety of ways including clinics, flyers and referrals from the CRC, as well as through snowball sampling and meeting with families at a local wheelchair hockey league. Strong relationships were built between the researchers and the CRC in order to build trust and rapport between the health practitioners, client's families and the research team.</p>

        <p>Data analysis began once the focus group and narrative interviews were transcribed verbatim by the first author and coded using thematic and interactional analysis within each interview, as well as between the sets of interviews. As the coding process continued, several sub themes developed under each main theme. Coding continued until a set of secondary sub themes was created. In total there were 9 main themes, 81 subthemes and 122 secondary subthemes. For example, theme #1 was entitled <em>sexuality and sex education</em>, subtheme #1b <em>was talking about sexuality with parents</em> and a secondary subtheme of that (1b-v) was <em>parents' view of their own child's sexuality</em>. The most significant themes and quotes were extracted by examining which themes were not only brought up most often, but also which ones contained the most significant and meaningful information that related to the study’s overall research goals.</p>

        <p>Ethical considerations are important for any study and particular attention must be paid to the ethical implications involved in working with vulnerable groups such as minors, people with disabilities and those at high risk for sexual abuse and exploitation. This study was approved by both the University's Research Ethics Board, as well as the CRC's Research Advisory Committee prior to commencement of the project. These approvals ensured that confidentiality, security of information, free and informed consent, and the physical, psychological and emotional safety and wellbeing of the participants were addressed and accounted for. Pseudonyms were used for all of the participants from the beginning of the recruitment process in order to ensure anonymity since the disability community in this particular area is fairly small and interconnected. Youth participants were given the opportunity to choose their own pseudonyms, in order to give them a sense of pride and ownership in the research process, in the way they were represented, and to make them feel as though their opinions mattered on many different levels. The parents were given pseudonyms and the health professionals were identified only by their occupation. The names of rare or easily identifiable health conditions and characteristics were generalized in order to protect the identity of the youth participants and their families.</p>

        <p><h2>Findings</h2></p>

        <p>The findings reported on in this paper constitute the most common themes mentioned by youth participants relating their experiences with sexuality education as well as the delivery and perception of that education from the points of view of parents and health professionals. The youth discussed their frustration with the overall lack of disability-specific sex education they had received, stemming largely from what they believe to be a societal stigma surrounding sexuality and disability. Parents and health professionals expressed similar viewpoints, however, they felt inadequately prepared to provide sexual education and believed that it was someone else's responsibility to convey this important information to these youth. It was important to share the opinions of all three of the participant groups in this paper since each group provided a diverse and uniquely specific insight into their own personal experiences with the issues in this study. Since the lives and stories of the participants are heavily interconnected with one another it was important to present the findings thematically rather than by participant group, in order to fully understand the diverse, interwoven and at times conflicting beliefs of the three groups participating in this study.</p>

        <p><em>"I Talked ... She Didn't Talk":</em> Experiences of Sex Education</p>

        <p>A salient theme that was brought up in every youth interview was the lack of sex education that the youth had received from their primary health providers, as Elena, a 20 year old who has Cerebral Palsy said,</p>

        <p><em>"I've never had a doctor just say ‘are you having sex?"</em> This lack of acknowledgement about the youth's need for information and advice related to sexuality and sexual health lead to a lack of understanding for many of the youth as to what their own sexual and reproductive capabilities were, as Elena explains, <em>"for a long time I questioned even could I have sex?... [laughs] was that possible?</em> As a result of this lack of disability specific sex education from their health care providers, several of the youth explained how they would supplement their general sexual knowledge with disability specific information they acquired on their own accord, as Justin, a 15 year old who has Spina Bifida explains: "Like I ... if I learnt something in class in sex ed ... then I'll go home on the computer and search up like ... I try to learn more about it ... and see if there are any topics of it for people with disabilities."</p>

        <p>While the youth preferred to find out the sexual information they needed from anonymous sources such as the internet, many of the parents who were interviewed explained how important it was for them to be open and frank with their children when talking about sex. A common theme appeared throughout many of the interviews, where the parents were much more open and willing to discuss sexuality than their teenaged children were. As Catherine, the mother of 20 year old Grace who has a neurological disorder explains, <em>"I mean I talked ... she didn't talk ... but she listened ... so I thought, well she’s not talking about it but she’s definitely listening to me. Catherine also said, "I've been open with her, she’s not always been very open with me."" Tessa, Olivia's mother shared a similar viewpoint: I think she feels less comfortable than we are ... probably because we start talking about it too much right ... cause she probably got the answer in the first two minutes and we talk about it for fifteen minutes."</em> Some of the parents were aware that their children had already been involved in intimate relationships which made discussing sex with their children a very relevant issue in order to ensure their safety and wellbeing. However, for some parents whose children were struggling with social isolation and bullying, they believed that talking about sex could actually be more damaging than useful. Here Patrick, the father of two adolescents who both have degenerative disabilities, explains:</p>

        <p><q>We try and be as open as we can ... it's different for each of them, but it's ... it's not a frequent topic of conversation because it's so sensitive ... because of the isolation they both have socially ... you know, why talk about something that's really ... not gonna say it's not in the cards, but it's certainly not um ... in the moment.</q></p>

        <p>The health professionals explained that they were also aware of the social isolation that many of their young clients faced and described how this, combined with societal misconceptions about disability and sexuality, as well as a fear of embarrassment and further alienation, meant that many of their young clients miss out on much of the sex education that takes place through informal peer interactions, as one social worker explains:</p>

        <p>They do get their education from the hallways or from school but they ... the young people I work with feel like they are very limited because it comes to a point where they aren’t turning to their other peers saying well how do you get your Depends off [laughs] ... or how do you pick your date up?</p>

        <p><em>"I think they see them as a non-person"</em>: The Myth of Asexuality</p>

        <p>Throughout the entire study, all of the participants brought up the idea that generally speaking people with disabilities are seen as "less than" those who are able bodied as Tessa explains, <em>"I think they see them as a non-person in some ways."</em> While many of the participants expressed their anger with the widespread discrimination towards people with disabilities they had either witnessed or experienced, the participants mainly discussed their frustration with the pervasive societal misconception that people with disabilities are either unable to or completely uninterested in engaging in any form of sexual relationship or expression, a belief that is often referred to as the myth of asexuality [<a href="#ref7">7</a>]. From the youth's perspective, they believed that the myth of asexuality was clearly tied to the belief that people with disabilities cannot be sexual, "I think people think people with disabilities don't have sexuality" (Elena), or should not be sexual, "I think that society naturally has a view that you know, if you're disabled then you're naturally discouraged from having sex" (Lilly).</p>

        <p>The health professionals described the challenges that many parents they have worked with at the CRC face when dealing with their medically fragile children, while still having to face the fact that their youth who has a disability deserves to be treated as an independent, capable and sexual being. One nurse explains,</p>

        <p><q>Some of the kids have had a really rough start and they've arrested [gone into cardiac arrest] ... so these are parents that won't even let ... the kids sleep in their own bed, they'll sleep with them in case they have a seizure in the night ... you know they're just paranoid, and for good reason ... so it’s really hard for them [to let go].</q></p>

        <p>Many of the parents also discussed why having a child with complex medical challenges meant that issues related to sexuality did not always seem like pertinent, or even relevant topics for discussion, as Catherine states, "I think for a lot of them [other parents], it probably doesn't even cross their mind ... I think had she been more severely disabled, it might not have crossed my mind." Patrick communicated a similar viewpoint that the severity of both his children’s physical condition, as well as their lack of social interaction, did not make sex education a priority in his family, "in our experience in having two children with no friends ... um no, there’s not a whole lot of information about sexuality that we are [laughs] begging to find."</p>

        <p>Several of the parents held positive beliefs towards their child's sexuality and entitlement for sexual fulfillment, as Catherine states, "you know that even though your child is in a wheelchair ... you know it doesn't mean that they’re not going to have ... um ... a sex life, and as a parent you should talk to them just to reassure them that they can have a sex life". Patrick shared in this opinion as he actively disputed the myth of asexuality among people with disabilities, "I guess the bottom line is that they deserve to be sexual, just like ... every person does right". However, he also expressed a certain level of ambivalence towards his own children's sexuality. This is evident in his response to the question posted by the first author: <em>"Do you think your kids see themselves as sexual beings?"</em> to which Patrick answered, <em>"No...no, do they want to? Absolutely ... but no, I don't think so."</em></p>

        <p><em>"There's some 'Not in my Backyard Issues'"</em>: Blaming Others and Anxieties about Sexuality</p>

        <p>The participants often placed the blame for the lack of adequate sex education among youth with physical disabilities on other groups in the disability community that they were not a part of. The health professionals tended to name the school system and parents as the greatest barriers against them providing comprehensive sex education to their clients. An occupational therapist explained the challenges he faced when he encouraged the educators at his client's school to discuss healthy sexuality, <em>"I think inappropriate sexuality, schools are very comfortable discussing that with you ... regular sexuality, not very comfortable discussing with you."</em> As well, a social worker explains the challenges she faces when dealing with sex education and parents:</p>

        <p><q>Parents are certainly a barrier ... you know, that ... you are aware that it's somebody's kid and that they have parents ... it's interesting as a professional you have almost the same barrier as the teenagers themselves do right, I'm just aware that it's somebody's daughter, it's somebody's son and ... this is pretty important stuff.</q></p>

        <p>The parents tended to believe that it was the health professionals' responsibility to provide disability specific sex education and counselling to their children. They believed that not only could the doctors provide these families with well-informed advice about the child's future physiological and reproductive capabilities, but many of the parents felt that by bringing up these issues with their young patients the health professionals would be helping to validate the youth’s position as a sexual being in society:</p>

        <p><q>Oh I think it would make a big impact on them [the youth] ... I think if they [the health professionals] were saying it's quite possible or whatever then I'm sure they would probably ... 'oh well the doctor said so, it's probably ok,' you know" (Marie, mother of Elena).</q></p>

        <p>Some of the parents explained that in their experience, many of the health providers they dealt with were not adequately prepared to handle difficult or sensitive topics, whether these issues related to sexuality, or in the case of Patrick's son Tyler who has Muscular Dystrophy, mortality. Patrick explained that "even among the health professionals I guess it's just a taboo subject that ... [they] will avoid like the plague". "I think there's some "not in my backyard issues" surrounding that ... and this whole sexuality thing fits right in there with that."</p>

        <p>Fear and anxiety about how to approach and discuss sexuality for these youth play very strong roles in the lives of the parents and professionals, and not only prevent youth from receiving appropriate sexual education but also end up reproducing the associations between disability and asexuality that all of the participants identify as highly problematic. Lilly, a 19 year old who has Cerebral Palsy explained that in her peer group sex is not something which is ever discussed, "we'll never go ... hey! how’s your sex life?... because ... I think I was afraid of it before and I think a lot of people ... still are just really not comfortable with sharing it." Patrick described the taboo nature that he believes is associated with sexuality among people with disabilities, "I think that the whole issue around sexuality is a huge elephant in the room that's there. It exists, and even as parents you tend to not be totally open and frank and wanna talk about it."</p>

        <p>For some of the health professionals, their anxiety towards discussing sexuality issues with their clients went beyond general discomfort or being unprepared to handle the situation. One male occupational therapist explained where his hesitation towards discussing these types of issues arises from, <em>"there is an added stigma of being a male that works with children ... definite added stigma and vulnerability there for sure."</em> He was very aware of the possible negative consequences that may occur if his intentions were misunderstood by a parent or caregiver:</p>

        <p><q>There's nothing necessarily stopping them from going home and saying 'hey guess what, so and so talked to me about sex today' ... and that has all of the ramifications for my particular practice, my livelihood.</q></p>

        <p><em>"It's a Big Hole."</em> Need for More Specialized Resources and Support</p>

        <p>For many years the CRC held a specialized teen clinic for their young clients with physical disabilities, whereby a specially trained doctor could openly discuss a wide range of issues with the youth, including sexuality, without their parents being in the room. Due to a lack of resources and a relocation of the doctor, the CRC is no longer offering this clinic. Here a nurse explains the repercussions that the cancellation of this clinic has had on their adolescent clients:</p>

        <p>That clinic has recently stopped because the doctor had moved away and it's a big hole, I can see it now. Those issues are not being addressed as are all the other teen issues are not being addressed with that population in a regular multi-doctor clinic. So ... um ... defi- nitely there needs to be a good forum for discussing these issues.</p>

        <p>While many of the youth explained that they did receive some general sex education in school, none of the youth received any kind of disability specific sex information at school or in a health care setting like the teen clinic. Justin shared his frustration with the lack of disability specific sex information he had received:</p>

        <p>I do wish that there would be more um ... information about sexuality for people with disabilities ... I think there is a lot more information about sexuality for people who are not with disabilities ... too much of it ... I think it should be more balanced out.</p>

        <p>The youth participants also believed it would be beneficial for sexuality and disability to be discussed in a mainstream sex education class, in an attempt to try and breakdown the myths and misconceptions surrounding disability and asexuality. Elena explains why this type of inclusion is particularly important for the social integration of youth with disabilities into a mainstream peer setting:</p>

        <p><q>E: I think it can only be beneficial to have a quick session on disability and sex</q></p>
        <p><q>I: What if there was no one in the class who had a disability, do you think it could still be useful?</q></p>
        <p><q>E: I think it could still be useful, cause I think some people are afraid to go up to someone at a dance and dance with them cause they don't know ... how to like interact with them in that way.</q></p>

        <p>Parents, youth and health professionals all expressed the opinion that sex education for youth with disabilities, as well as able bodied youth, needs to be more holistic and cover a wider range of social and emotional issues rather than simply teaching the 'nuts and bolts' of reproduction and contraception. <em>"I really think there needs to be more education on that instead of ... just put a condom on and everything will be ok ... cause that doesn't always work."</em> (Justin). Patrick emphasized the need for specialized sex education for youth with disabilities who face unique social challenges like his own two children, <em>"maybe that's where you start ... how do I get friends?... before you start talking about wearing a condom."</em> Along with social challenges, issues such as pleasure and positive sexuality are often omitted from sex education discussions for both able bodied youth and those who have disabilities, as Lilly explains, <em>"nobody ever really discussed with me like how people in wheelchairs actually ... um ... achieve sexual pleasure."</em> The participants shared a common viewpoint that was congruent with the current sexuality and disability research in that from the limited sex education that many of these youth received, the majority of the information that was provided to them tended to problematize sexuality, focusing mainly on topics related to safety and protection. None of the participants discussed any education they had received which focused on positive sexuality, such as touch, self-stimulation, arousal, intimacy and healthy relationships. The need for a more holistic, integrated sex education experience is both encouraged by researchers [<a href="#ref33">33</a>, <a href="#ref34">34</a>], and deemed necessary by many members of the disability community. Implications, recommendations and possible solutions for improving the experience of sex education for young people with physical disabilities are discussed below.</p>

        <p><h2>Discussion</h2></p>

        <p>The overall objective of this study was to gain a greater understanding of the experiences faced by young people with physical disabilities in receiving sex education and information, as well as the barriers and challenges faced by parents and health professionals in delivering sexuality information to these youth. Research shows that it is beneficial for adolescents with physical disabilities to receive a combination of general comprehensive sexual education and skill development, as well as specific information that is tailored towards their individual needs [<a href="#ref13">13</a>, <a href="#ref33">33</a>]. The youth participants in this study shared a similar view that youth with physical disabilities could benefit from better quality sex education from a variety of trusted adults in their lives, including their parents, educators and health professionals. The findings from this study also showed that while the youth felt that they were as sexually capable and deserving as any of their able bodied peers, they believed that the widespread stigma and misconceptions surrounding sexuality and disability prevented them from receiving adequate information and support about their own sexuality and sexual health needs and thus impeded on their acceptance as sexual citizens within society.</p>

        <p>Another common theme related to sex education throughout the study was that the parents and health professionals were generally underprepared and misinformed as to the "correct" way to provide this type of potentially sensitive information to these youth. This could be why these participants often deflected the responsibility of sex education onto another group within the community. Further research surrounding the issues of sex education, confidence and competency among parents, health professionals, counsellors and educators would be highly beneficial in order to better understand the misconceptions, anxiety and knowledge gaps that often prevent these caregivers from providing necessary advice and information to the youth they interact with. Additional studies in these areas would help guide the development of improved training and resources to help support these members of the disability community in order to adequately and confidently educate youth with physical disabilities about their sexual questions and concerns. Drawing from the data gathered in this study, along with relevant literature, several important insights can be made regarding how parents, health professionals and educators could improve the quality and comfort level of their interactions with adolescents who have physical disabilities regarding discussions around sexuality and sex education.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Implications for Parents</h3></p>

        <p>While adolescents do receive their sex education from a variety of sources, including school, peers, family and the media, parents are the primary source of sex education for children during the highly influential and formative years before puberty begins [<a href="#ref35">35</a>]. As a result, it is important for parents to discuss the same issues related to decision making, values, dating, body image, peer pressure, self-esteem, safe sex and personal safety that would be discussed with a child who does not have a disability throughout their childhood and into adolescence. There is a need for more accessible and relevant resources, websites, information sheets and workshops available to parents on how to discuss sexuality issues with their adolescents who have physical disabilities. However, there are several safe, positive and accessible sex education websites aimed at adolescents which parents could direct their children to, in order for their youth to gain some of the sexual knowledge they may be interested in but too embarrassed to ask their parents about directly. Parents may also benefit from one-on-one time with their child’s health care providers to ask questions about dating, sexuality, fertility and reproduction that may be uncomfortable to ask while the youth is present.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Implications for Health Professionals</h3></p>

        <p>There are several recent studies which have looked at the adolescent- health professional relationship in terms of discussing issues related to sexuality. It is recommended that in order to meet the unique needs of adolescents with physical disabilities, health professionals should address sexual issues using a holistic, adolescent friendly approach [<a href="#ref34">34</a>]. Since it was found that concern about confidentiality is the primary reason why adolescents do not seek counselling related to sexual health [<a href="#ref36">36</a>], it is imperative that health care providers offer youth with physical disabilities care that is confidential, collaborative and tailored to the adolescent's individual developmental and physical needs [<a href="#ref37">37</a>].</p>

        <p>A need for more specialized "Teen Clinics", such as the one described by the participants, would be particularly beneficial by allowing young clients who have physical disabilities an opportunity to meet with their health professional on their own so that they can discuss sexuality issues that may be too sensitive or awkward to bring up while their parents are present. Having a health professional who is non-judgemental and speaks in matter-of-fact, "adolescent-friendly" language will help the adolescent understand that a health care setting is a safe, appropriate place to ask questions related to sexuality, sexual development, sexual function and fertility [<a href="#ref38">38</a>].</p>

        <p>It is also important for health care providers to use teachable moments to offer important information about sexuality, birth control, and reproduction. For example, when discussing latex allergies with adolescent clients who have Spina Bifida, one could emphasize the importance of safe sex by teaching the client about non-latex condoms and other forms of birth control. This not only provides the youth with potentially lifesaving information, but it also validates his/her position as a fully capable sexual being in society. More sexuality and disability-related training would be beneficial for current and future health care professionals, in order to give them the knowledge and confidence needed to initiate these important but often overlooked discussions with their young clients.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Implication for Educators and Counsellors</h3></p>

        <p>Although health practitioners can provide youth with physical disabilities information about their sexual functioning and reproductive capabilities, educations and counsellors can provide the important psychological, social and emotional support that adolescents with disabilities may require to deal with their sexuality questions and issues. However, similar to the hesitation or feelings of being unprepared that many health professionals face when dealing with these issues, it was found that relationship and sexual therapists often feel greater levels of anxiety towards working with clients who have physical disabilities [<a href="#ref39">39</a>]. Counsellors can provide assistance in several ways by providing more in depth and age appropriate sex education info, helping these adolescents develop and maintain social relationships, working on issues related to self-esteem and self-image concerns, as well as helping family members identify and communicate their own values to their children [<a href="#ref40">40</a>]. Whether in a one on one counseling session or a large classroom setting, educators and counsellors should try to promote a sex positive environment that emphasizes the importance of touch, intimacy, communication, healthy relationships and self-confidence, as well as the safety issues related to birth control, sexually transmitted infections and sexual abuse. There is also an overwhelming need for more mainstream sex education resources and information that aim to break down some of the negative stigma and misconceptions surrounding sexuality and people with physical disabilities. One method that educators could use to combat these misconceptions is to incorporate examples of people with disabilities into mainstream sex education classes. Even if there are no students with disabilities in the class, this will help breakdown some of the widespread myths and stereotypes about people with disabilities being asexual by allowing students to understand that everyone is a sexual being, regardless of their physical capabilities.</p>

        <p><h2>Study Limitations</h2></p>

        <p>The goal of this study was not to generalize the experience of learning about sexuality and sex education for all adolescents living with physical disabilities, but rather to learn about the personal experiences, opinions and perspectives from a varied range of unique individuals belonging to the disability community. As a result of the in-depth narrative design of the research, combined with the low number of youth who fit the inclusion criteria for the study, the age-range and gender diversity of the youth participants may have been somewhat limited. However, in a narrative study such as this, where each individual voice is seen as uniquely important and pertinent to the overall study, a similarity in demographic information of the participants is not seen as a limitation of this particular study. Having said that, it would have been beneficial to have had an equal number of boys and girls participating in the study, only since having one male youth made it difficult to explore and draw conclusions about sexuality and disability issues based on gender. The issue of gender imbalance also applied to the parent participants, since only one out of the four parents involved was male. However, this type of imbalance was anticipated because a large proportion of the parents who attend clinics with their children at the CRC are mothers.</p>

        <p>Another limitation of this study was that it only included adolescents with physical disabilities who volunteered to participate and were fully capable of verbally expressing their opinion on sexuality and other issues explored in this study. For many youth who have additional developmental, cognitive or sensory impairments, as well as those who are exceedingly shy or socially isolated, issues of sexuality are rarely addressed. This study also involved families who were already well-connected with the CRC and many other disability services within their community. This may have posed a limitation since it was less likely that families who were marginalized from medical and social support services would have had the opportunity to learn about and take part of the study. As a result, the findings of this study may not necessarily represent the experience of all youth living with physical disabilities in Canada.</p>

        <p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p>

        <p>This study aimed to gain a greater understanding into the experiences of sex education for adolescents with physical disabilities and in turn, how these experiences influenced the way they viewed themselves as sexual beings. The issues presented in this paper highlight the importance of improved sex education resources and services tailored to youth with disabilities, as well as parents, educators and health care providers. This information is particularly significant as it is related to the overall treatment and acceptance of people with disabilities as fully functional sexual beings, who deserve an equal opportunity to receive information and advice on staying as sexually healthy and fulfilled as the rest of able bodied society. Conducting and disseminating qualitative research such as the information highlighted in this paper is one way to reduce the pervasive social stigma that is often associated with disability and sexuality. However, further work needs to be done in order to educate the public about the myth of asexuality and the detrimental effects this kind of misjudgement can have on a person’s self-esteem, confidence and overall feelings of self-worth.</p>

        <p>This paper outlined the issue of responsibility deflection and diversion among the parents, educators and health professionals interacting with adolescents who have disabilities. The participants in this study highlighted the tendency for these groups to place the responsibility of delivering sex education to these young people on someone else who they believe to be more qualified. It was found that many of these adults are often afraid of giving the adolescent incorrect information or getting into trouble by another authority figure in the youth's life. It is evident that future work needs to be done in order to integrate the sex education that adolescents with disabilities receive by providing ways for parents, educators and health professionals to collaborate and work together when issues related to sexuality and sex education arise. This would allow each group to provide the tailored information that best suits their level of expertise on sexuality issues, disability specific information and the individual adolescent they are talking to. The findings from this study also indicate a particular need for high quality, easily accessible resources, services, training and support for parents, educators and health professionals. These resources can help to build up a strong knowledge base around the area of sex education and improved confidence when delivering this type of information to young people with physical disabilities.</p>

        <p>Learning about the experience of sexuality and sex education for adolescents with physical disabilities not only helps to open up lines of communication regarding sensitive topics such as sexual exploration, self-esteem, inclusion, the importance of intimacy and the need for independence; it also legitimizes the important but often ignored fact that young people with disabilities are sexual beings and deserve an equal opportunity to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to engage in safe, healthy, and fulfilling relationships throughout their lives.</p>
