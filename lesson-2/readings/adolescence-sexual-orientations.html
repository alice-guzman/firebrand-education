        <p>Adolescents face a number of important developmental milestones. In the interpersonal realm, honing development of capacities for intimacy, sexuality, and affiliation is a crucial task, and chief among these capacities are understanding and integrating sexual orientation. These are challenging tasks for any adolescent, but are especially so for non‐heterosexual youth. The process of "coming out" for such youth may be conceptualized as an additional developmental event. Misinformation, prejudice, and isolation complicate these processes for non‐heterosexual youth, but support, informational and interpersonal resources, and effective role models allow for successful resolution and integration.</p>

        <p>The development and emergence of sexual orientation are arguably among the most important milestones in human development, certainly among Euro‐American youth, and perhaps more universally to varying degrees. According to the American Psychological Association (<a href="#apa2008">APA 2008</a>, para. 2) during adolescence, individuals develop an "enduring pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, or both sexes." Successfully integrating one's sexual orientation helps establish a sense of identity and promotes healthy self‐esteem, allowing individuals to construct a stable foundation from which to explore other areas of life (<a href="#apa2008">APA 2008</a>).</p>

        <p>Most adolescents are afforded an environment conducive to achieving comfort with their sexual orientation; however, others—usually, those who identify as non‐heterosexual—are often faced with a disparaging environment that impedes exploration of their sexual orientations. Subsequently, these additional challenges may complicate achieving or accomplishing other milestones, and often manifest as mental health concerns (i.e., low self‐esteem, depression, suicidality), but can include overt manifestations (i.e., bullying or physical abuse). These manifestations can differ by gender.</p>

        <p><h2>When do we know</h2></p>

        <p>Awareness of sexual orientation typically begins in middle childhood through early adolescence (APA 2008). For heterosexual youths raised in a positive and supportive environment, this process generally progresses smoothly. Children recognize they are attracted to the opposite sex and begin developing the heterosexual identities mirrored in the environment. This is assumed as normative, and reinforced. The universal developmental tasks of differentiating intimacy, sexuality, and affiliation, and of developing identity, behavioral skills, and emotional integrity surrounding these are complicated; but heterosexual orientation in itself is not a complicating factor, since it is valued. Non‐heterosexual adolescents face the same developmental challenges, with additional stressors that their orientations are not mirrored and are therefore unclear, with minimal environmental support and sometimes disparagement. Such youth often feel pressure to conform, lack information, and feel different, defective and "wrong." Since environments and people vary in the strength of the expressed negativity to non‐heterosexuality,  avigating the interpersonal environment is realistically complex, even daunting. Not surprisingly, the difficulties previously mentioned can occur even in environments with significant support, and are predictably exacerbated as negativity of the environment increases. Some attempt to suppress non‐ heterosexual desires to feel accepted; but this often creates negative self‐identification. <a href="#vaughn2009">Vaughn and Waehler (2009)</a> discovered that individuals who "come out" experience a more positive self‐identity, feel more authentic and self‐accepting, and are less ashamed; but the converse is true for those who avoid self‐acknowledgment.</p>

        <p><h2>Coming out—an additional developmental event?</h2></p>

        <p>As clinicians and researchers observed these differences in the ways heterosexual and non‐heterosexual youth approached their sexual orientations, they developed theories to explicate these differences, loosely termed "coming out" models. While these theoreticians (Cass, Coleman, Gonsiorek and Rudolph, Hencken and O'Dowd, and others, as described in <a href="#gonsiorek1991">Gonsiorek and Rudolph 1991</a>) varied in the specifics, they all described how non‐heterosexual people conceptualize and act on their sexual orientations. These models generally asserted that individuals experience stages in this process, involving milestones such as: a dim recognition of non‐heterosexuality; psychological reactions  gainst such recognition; eventual acknowledgment of non‐heterosexual desires; disclosure to others and initial forays into dating and sexual contact; psychological reactions to these; development of supportive community; and eventual psychological integration. This list oversimplifies the diversity of these models, and <a href="#gonsiorek1991">Gonsiorek and Rudolph (1991)</a> can be consulted for a more detailed summary.</p>

        <p>It became apparent that these models had significant weaknesses. They best described the life experiences of majority culture, middle‐class individuals coming of age in the 1970s and 1980s, and their applicability to other age cohorts appears less precise. They neglected to factor in other aspects of identity, such as class and ethnicity, whose developmental ramifications are co‐occurring in time with sexual orientation. The models fit males better than females, as gender differences are significant; and are likely particularly incomplete with transgender individuals. Finally, the models are  nsufficiently psychological in that they do not factor in how other, developmentally earlier, aspects of psychological resilience and vulnerability are the matrices through which "coming out" is filtered. Gonsiorek and Rudolph made some preliminary efforts to address these concerns, but more elaboration is needed</p>

        <p>Despite the significant limitations of these models, they offer a preliminary framework for understanding some of what is different for non‐heterosexual adolescents. While these models usually posit that the processes described can occur at any age, they occur most commonly in adolescence.</p>

        <p>The models help explain the research that suggests that when adolescents begin the process of coming out, they are fearful of its ramifications (<a href="#glimps2005">Glimps 2005</a>). Despite advances made in acceptance of non‐heterosexuality, considerable difficulties that non‐heterosexual people face remain. They often are fearful of being physically or verbally abused, ostracized in social settings, loss of employment, and other forms of discrimination and prejudice (<a href="#herek1991">Herek 1991</a>). Due to these very real adverse outcomes (often magnified by the high degree of gender stereotyping during adolescence), it is difficult for non‐heterosexual youths to come out, and without adequate information, resources, and support, they can be at risk for mental health consequences (see <a href="#gonsiorek1988">Gonsiorek 1988</a>).</p>

        <p><a href="#riversgordon2010">Rivers and Gordon (2010)</a> explained that the coming‐out process is never‐ending. Non‐heterosexual people will continually have to come out as they encounter a variety of different contexts (<a href="#riversgordon2010">Rivers and Gordon 2010</a>). Previously, people came out in their late adolescence−early adulthood; however, research shows that today people are coming out earlier. <a href="#savinwilliams2005">Savin‐Williams (2005)</a> and <a href="#rossi2010">Rossi (2010)</a> show that 5–6 percent of youths are coming out in grades 7 through 12. Moreover, 30 years ago people were coming out ten years later than they are today (<a href="#rossi2010">Rossi 2010</a>; <a href="#savinwilliams2005">Savin‐Williams 2005</a>). <a href="#lehoczky2005">Lehoczky (2005)</a> found that many youths are coming out between the ages of 14 and 16 and that some youth even come out as early as fifth grade. <a href="#lehoczky2005">Lehoczky (2005)</a> has attributed the early coming out to cultural shifts and supportive environments (i.e., home and school). Essentially, it appears that by making the public aware of different sexual orientations, the current generation is more comfortable with disclosure.</p>

        <p><h2>"If you prick us, do we not bleed?" (William Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice, Act III, scene 1)</h2></p>

        <p>Even though research suggests the current generation is more comfortable with disclosing their sexual orientations, non‐heterosexual individuals still face many struggles. Simply stated, the external disparagement and the incorporation of that disparagement into one's sense of self create adverse psychological and other consequences for non‐heterosexual youth. <a href="#frankowski2004">Frankowski (2004)</a> explained that non‐heterosexual adolescents are more likely than their heterosexual peers to drop out of school, be kicked out of their homes, use and abuse substances (i.e., tobacco, alcohol, illegal drugs), live on the streets, and have multiple sexual partners. They are at greater risk for being forced into sexual relationships, including rape, and being exposed to sexually transmitted infections (STIs). They are at a higher risk for suicide than heterosexual youths, and are at a 2−4 times greater risk for being threatened with a weapon at school due to their sexual orientation (<a href="#frankowski2004">Frankowski 2004</a>). Adolescents of a race other than white face even more problems because of racism (<a href="#frankowski2004">Frankowski 2004</a>). These behavioral health risks encompass medical risk as well. Not surprisingly given the risks described above, non‐heterosexual adolescent males, especially African American males, are at especially high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).</p>

        <p>According to <a href="#rosario2006">Rosario, Schrimshaw, and Hunter (2006)</a>, the coming‐out process and sexual risk behaviors (defined as engagement in unprotected/non‐safe sex and/or having multiple partners) have been linked to a variety of problems. Youths who engage in risky sexual behaviors have been found to have "fewer positive attitudes towards homosexuality, involvement in fewer gay‐related social activities, a discomfort with others learning about [their] sexuality, [and] not having a defined gay identity" (<a href="#rosario2006">Rosario et al. 2006</a>:para. 6). Moreover, non‐heterosexual youths who experience victimization or are  idiculed for their sexual orientation may engage in risky sexual behavior. <a href="#rosario2006">Rosario et al. (2006)</a> also found that those who were sexually abused as children have more sexual partners and engage in unprotected anal sex more frequently. Such findings are typical of the literature on non‐heterosexual youth and are congruent with what is known about other socially disparaged groups; while the particulars vary by group, all such targets of discrimination suffer differing combinations of adverse medical, behavioral, health, economic, and public health outcomes.</p>

        <p><h2>Where next</h2></p>

        <p>Research consistently indicates that as support for and self‐acceptance in non‐heterosexual youth increase, so positive behavioral, medical health, and social functioning outcomes increase. The reverse is also true, which provides a strong public health argument for public policy efforts to support non‐heterosexual youth. Future research will likely adumbrate in greater detail those factors that foster resilience and manage vulnerability in non‐heterosexual youth generally, as well as map those individualized personal and family characteristics that contribute. But the extant  iterature is sufficiently clear to conclude that rational and humane public policy will create supportive structures and roles for non‐heterosexual youth, and thus engage in primary prevention of most of the risks faced by these youth. An irresponsible public policy will foster and tolerate discrimination toward non‐heterosexual youth and then castigate them for the predictable adverse outcomes.</p>
