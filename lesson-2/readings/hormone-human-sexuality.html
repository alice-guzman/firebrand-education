        <p style="margin-top: 0;">The current entry discusses the relationship between hormones, molecular signals released by various glands throughout the body, and sexuality among humans. Hormones have an important impact on numerous areas of sexuality including sexual differentiation, anatomy, physiology, and behavior. The hormones discussed in this entry are androgens, estrogens, progesterone, gonadotropins, oxytocin, and prolactin. Examples of the relationship between hormones and areas of human sexuality are discussed.</p>

        <p>As typically defined, hormones are molecules released by glands, with these molecules traveling through the circulatory system until bound by receptors in target tissues. Hormones carry important information about sex, age, reproductive condition, health status, and social context. Hormones can alter aspects of human sexuality, as when estrogen and androgen at puberty coordinate various changes in anatomy, physiology, and behavior. Aspects of sexuality, such as mate availability, can also alter hormones. This entry discusses the role of androgens (such as testosterone), estrogens (such as estradiol), progesterone, gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone, follicle stimulating hormone), oxytocin, and prolactin in human sexuality. The relationships between these hormones and human sexuality are considered across the life course and with respect to key factors such as reproductive and health status.</p>

        <p><h2>Sex steroids</h2></p>

        <p>The sex steroid hormones are named for their important role in the development of sex differences and expression of sexual behavior. The three classes of steroid hormones discussed here are androgens, progesterone, and the estrogens.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Androgen</h3></p>

        <p>Androgen refers to a set of steroid hormones including testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Most of the focus in this entry is on testosterone given its central role in sex differentiation and sexual behavior. Testosterone is produced mainly by the testes in males, and by the ovaries and adrenal glands in females. During prenatal life, male gonads (testes) release testosterone. Testosterone in utero has masculinizing effects on the brain; after conversion to DHT, it also facilitates the development of primary male sexual characteristics (such as the penis and seminal vesicles). During puberty, testosterone is responsible for the development of male secondary sexual characteristics (such as upper body musculature, facial hair, and deepening voices). Disorders involving the androgens include Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH), Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome (AIS), and 5 α‐reductase deficiency. These androgenic disorders may have impacts on sexuality, including gender identity and sexual attraction. For example, individuals with complete AIS are genetic males, though are often identified as female at birth, develop many characteristics (e.g., breasts) of females, and typically report identifying as females.</p>

        <p>Male testosterone levels vary for a variety of reasons. Testosterone has a diurnal cycle in men, with highest levels around waking. In many vertebrates, including humans, testosterone levels increase in response to sexual stimuli. Testosterone levels may be lower among men involved in family relationships such as long‐term partnering and paternal care, consistent with a physiological shift away from mating effort (and perhaps physiologically invested in parenting rather than mating). Men with clinically low testosterone levels (hypogonadal) may report low sexual interest and low erectile response. Hypogonadal men may also experience problematic seminal emission. Normal testosterone production declines with age in men, which may impact sexual function (e.g., libido and erectile response) among older men. Men with low testosterone levels have successfully used exogenous testosterone, one method of hormone replacement therapy, as one means of increasing sexual function (see <a href="#bancroft2005">Bancroft 2005</a>).</p>

        <p>In females, testosterone is also associated with an increase in sexual function, with low testosterone typically manifesting as a decrease in sexual desire. Since much of female testosterone is released by the adrenal glands, women's levels can also increase during increased adrenal activity (e.g., during anxiety, stress, or depression) (see <a href="#bancroft2005">Bancroft 2005</a>).</p>

        <p>Women's testosterone levels exhibit small fluctuations across the menstrual cycle. Testosterone levels begin to rise during the follicular phase and reach a peak at mid‐cycle (e.g., near ovulation). During pregnancy—particularly the last trimester—testosterone production increases to the level of an average male. During the months following birth, testosterone release is suppressed by prolactin. Several placebo‐controlled clinical studies (reviewed in <a href="#davis2012">Davis and Braunstein 2012</a>) have reported positive effects on women's sexual function after treatment with testosterone (via injection or a transdermal patch) among women who are postmenopausal or women clinically diagnosed with hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Women's testosterone levels decline during menopause. Testosterone, along with estrogen and/or progesterone, may be administered as a hormone replacement therapy. Women receiving testosterone in addition to estrogen exogenously report higher increases in sexual desire compared to women receiving solely estrogen.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Progesterone</h3></p>

        <p>Progesterone is produced by the ovaries and the adrenal glands. Men have lower progesterone levels than do women of reproductive age. Male and female children have low levels of progesterone, along with postmenopausal women. In women of reproductive age, progesterone levels are relatively low during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle and increase during the luteal phase (after ovulation) to facilitate the production of a thicker endometrial lining within which a fertilized egg may implant. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels drop and menstruation occurs. During pregnancy, progesterone levels increase to support gestation. Progesterone production shifts from the ovaries to the placenta around the eighth week of gestation. Progesterone has an inhibitory effect on milk production. After birth, progesterone levels decrease, facilitating the production of breastmilk. Progesterone levels decrease in postmenopausal women. Synthetic progesterone, progestin, is often prescribed to postmenopausal women in addition to estrogens as part of hormone replacement therapies. Progestin‐only medications may also be prescribed to some women who have just given birth as a form of birth control.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Estrogens</h3></p>

        <p>The three main estrogens are estrone, estradiol, and estriol. Estrogen fluctuates in women across the menstrual cycle, with a peak in estradiol occurring around ovulation, a secondary peak during the luteal phase, and with low levels typically seen during the follicular phase. Shifts in heterosexual women's sexuality have been studied among regularly cycling women, with preferences for masculine traits such as deeper voices and square jaws more pronounced during times of high estradiol levels. Some studies report subtle changes in female libido and actual sexual behavior in relation to cyclical changes in estradiol. Many other studies don't find such changes, which may be because other factors such as involvement in a sexual relationship are more important determinants of sexual behavior. The estrogens increase during pregnancy as the placenta releases high concentrations of estriol, and these levels decline during breastfeeding. Postmenopausal women also have a decline in the estrogens. Pregnant, breastfeeding, or postmenopausal women sometimes report lower sexual desire, which may be related to the role of estrogens in female sexuality. Low estrogen levels also impact vaginal lubrication and vaginal elasticity. Women with low estrogen levels often report hyposexuality (low levels of sexual desire) or dyspareunia (pain during intercourse, in part because of inadequate lubrication during intercourse). Women with low estrogen levels, perhaps through medical or surgically induced menopause, may experience more difficulty becoming aroused and difficulty producing vaginal lubrication. Women entering into menopause typically report several side effects including a decrease in libido and a decline in vaginal elasticity and production of lubrication. Estrogen replacement therapy, sometimes used to combat side effects in postmenopausal women, has shown an increase in vaginal lubrication but not necessarily sexual desire. While the estrogens play an important role in sexual physiology, the impact of estrogens on sexual desire is less clear.</p>

        <p>The data on the effects of estrogen among men are limited. However, estrogen does appear to play an important role in the regulation of testosterone. Men who are taking exogenous estrogens have an increase in plasma testosterone levels. Men with gynecomastia, an increase in breast tissue, often have an imbalance between testosterone and estrogen, with higher levels of estrogen and lower levels of testosterone than males in the clinically normal range of testosterone and estrogens. Exogenous estrogens have also been used with sexual offenders and have been shown to reduce sexual desire and erectile response.</p>

        <p><h2>Gonadotropins</h2></p>

        <p>The hypothalamic‐pituitary‐gonadal (HPG) axis is responsible for the regulation of a woman's menstrual cycle. The hypothalamus releases gonadotropin‐releasing hormone (GnRH), which signals the pituitary to release luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH); LH and FSH are gonadotropin hormones. LH and FSH act as signals to the ovaries to release progesterone and testosterone (some of which is then converted to estradiol). Among women, LH and FSH are both secreted by the anterior pituitary and both hormones are important in facilitating ovulation. Among men and women, LH and FSH levels are low during childhood. Among postmenopausal women, LH levels are low while FSH levels are high.</p>

        <p>During women's reproductive years, release of LH by the anterior pituitary stimulates the release of the egg for ovulation. Accordingly, high levels of LH are noted in women beginning around the time of ovulation and are at lower levels throughout the nonfertile periods of the menstrual cycle. Some of the over‐the‐counter ovulation tests for women measure LH levels to assess the stage of ovulation. If a woman becomes pregnant, LH levels decrease and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is produced by the developing placenta to maintain luteal function. FSH stimulates growth of immature ovarian follicles in the ovary. During the reproductive years, FSH is typically higher around ovulation (like LH) but also has a pre‐ovulation increase between days three to five of the follicular phase.</p>

        <p>Among men, LH assists with the production of testosterone in the Leydig cells of the testis. In men, FSH plays a role in promoting the replication of the gametes during spermatogenesis.</p>

        <p>Abnormal levels of LH and FSH are associated with some disorders associated with reproduction including amenorrhea, polycystic ovary syndrome, and premature menopause in women and testicular failure in men. Abnormal levels of FSH are also associated with Klinefelter's syndrome and Turner syndrome.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Oxytocin</h3></p>

        <p>Oxytocin is a peptide hormone that is often associated with motherhood as it is responsible for uterine contractions during delivery and in breast milk release. Synthetic oxytocin may be given exogenously to aid women in labor. Oxytocin is implicated in romantic relationship behaviors including touch and massage. Oxytocin also rises in both men and women with orgasm from sexual stimulation, rising after coitus or self‐stimulation to orgasm. Oxytocin is implicated in many nonsexual arenas including reduction in anxiety and stress. Certain synthetic drugs stimulate oxytocin production with individuals reporting increased feelings of euphoria and connection to other individuals. Among women, there are subtle increases in oxytocin during ovulation. After giving birth, oxytocin increases during breastfeeding or touching the infant, fostering the view that oxytocin promotes bonding between mother and infant. Oxytocin's effects on muscle contraction have also been indicated as the cause of milk "letdown", breastmilk ejected from the milk ducts while the infant is suckling, or at times where the mother may receive stimulus from her infant (e.g., hearing the infant crying). The studies of postpartum oxytocin and maternal behavior in humans have typically been correlated with positive feelings (e.g., trust and empathy) and reduced stress (see <a href="#campbell2008">Campbell 2008</a> for a review). While oxytocin may promote maternal behaviors during motherhood (especially during breastfeeding), there may be a tradeoff against the mother's sexuality. Among women, oxytocin tends to decline after menopause.</p>

        <p><h3 class="titleLeft">Prolactin</h3></p>

        <p>Prolactin is a peptide hormone that plays an important role in reproduction in both men and women. It is produced in several tissues including breast tissue, the pituitary gland, and the prostate. Among women, prolactin prepares the mammary glands for the production of breastmilk, while oxytocin plays a role in stimulating the smooth muscle to release the breastmilk from the milk ducts. During pregnancy, prolactin levels increase, with the highest levels typically seen in the third trimester. The postbirth decrease in progesterone, combined with suckling, help initiate breastmilk release. After giving birth, prolactin levels begin to decline but are stimulated by sucking on the nipples. Prolactin levels decline, in time, with the continuation of breastfeeding.</p>

        <p>Among men and women prolactin is an antagonist to the sex steroids testosterone and estrogen. In women, prolactin has an inhibitory effect on regular ovulatory functioning. Among individuals with hyperprolactinemia, abnormally high levels of prolactin, one of the side effects commonly reported is low sexual functioning. Among men, this includes low sexual desire and low erectile functioning. Hyperprolactinemia among men is also commonly associated with low testosterone levels; however, higher levels of prolactin without low testosterone still have dampening effects on men's sexuality. Among women, hyperprolactinemia is associated with low sexual desire. During lactation, high prolactin levels are associated with amenorrhea. Postcoitus, prolactin levels decline and are associated with the refractory period among men (<a href="#levin2003">Levin 2003</a>), the time after orgasm in which males experience low sexual functioning for a finite amount of time before he can become aroused. On average, males experience an elevated production of prolactin postorgasm. Females, too, have an increase in prolactin levels postorgasm; however, women do not undergo the same refractory period as males.</p>

        <p><h2>Conclusion</h2></p>

        <p>Individuals, the media, and researchers often emphasize the differences between men's and women's sexuality. Meta‐analytic data support the notion that men and women are similar in sexuality more than they are different. Gender differences for 26 of the 30 sexual behaviors and attitudes either displayed no difference or the differences were small. This finding supports the gender similarities hypothesis, which states that for most, though not all, psychological indicators men and women are similar (<a href="#hyde2005">Hyde 2005</a>). Continuing to exaggerate gender differences in sexuality can be problematic for both genders. These stereotypes run the risk of perpetuating the double standard and leaving women and men who violate the stereotypes feeling inferior or inadequate. Emphasizing gender similarities rather than differences may contribute to gender equality of sexual expression (<a href="#petersen2010">Petersen and Hyde 2010</a>).</p>
