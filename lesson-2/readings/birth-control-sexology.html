        <p style="margin-top: 0;">In the late nineteenth century, early sexology supported Victorian conventions that saw sex as a primarily procreative activity and women as sexually passive. Yet sexology also helped transform attitudes to sexuality. Borrowing from Darwinian theory and popular eugenics, sexological theories began to promote non‐procreative sex and family planning in the interest of individual and national health. This development was a major factor in legitimizing the birth control movement in the first decades of the twentieth century, which criticized legal crackdowns on public discussion of contraception and abortion. In the United States and Western Europe, the birth control movement, alongside the feminist movement, began to win gradual but increasing respectability after World War II, leading to a renewed interest in sexology as the scientific study of diverse human sexual behaviors and desires. However, this entry argues that birth control has never been solely an issue of women's rights or individual sexual liberty, but is also a tool of population control which remains morally, politically, and economically controversial. State policies have supported drastic measures of birth control to wage race wars against poor and immigrant groups; and it is no longer clear how the scientific study of sex can resolve the political and moral issues surrounding national birth control policies.</p>

        <p>The naturalist Charles Darwin (1809−1882) argued that the same iron law of natural selection that ruled the whole of the animal kingdom governed human sexuality too (<a href="#darwin2008">Darwin 2008</a> [1871]). Darwin and many of his contemporaries saw human sexual behavior as a legitimate field of scientific inquiry and in the second half of the nineteenth century, numerous medical and anthropological studies were published on the subject. These early sexological works were responses to fears about European industrialization, population growth, urbanization, and the spread of sexual "vice" in modern cities (<a href="#oosterhus2000">Oosterhus 2000</a>). They sought to explain human sexual desire in all its varieties. Using the authoritative language of medical science, sexology emphasized in novel ways the link between human sexual behavior and human health. In the 1880s, Austro‐German psychiatrist Richard von Krafft‐Ebing (1840−1902) was one of the first to work on a systematic classification of human sexual behavior, recording what he saw as the key obstacles to healthy sexual instincts.</p>

        <p>Early sexologists like Krafft‐Ebing supported Victorian conventions that regarded procreative sex as the only healthy form of sexual activity and viewed women as sexually passive. Yet new currents of social thought were contesting these attitudes. Darwin's theory of sexual selection portrayed women as active in sexual selection, choosing mates on the basis of traits that would prove competitively advantageous in the struggle for life and thus worth reproducing in future generations. Darwin was also influenced by the idea that high birth rates weakened the species, a standpoint inspired by Thomas Malthus (1766−1834), who had argued that population growth, unless checked, was a social evil. After the publication of Malthus's <em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em> (1798), many began to debate the role of the state in providing for the poor and regulating sexual reproduction. Pioneers of statistics, like Darwin's cousin Francis Galton (1822−1911), suggested that the state sponsor sexual reproduction between evolutionarily desirable individuals, thereby ensuring the survival and prosperity of the nation's finest. Galton's science, strongly affiliated with that of sexology, was the science of eugenics, which taught that humans could exert a large degree of control over sexual reproduction, and thus the direction of human evolution. It was partly because of the popularity and spread of eugenics that it became increasingly acceptable for sexologists to discuss women's role in sexual reproduction, emphasizing the responsibility of the state, medical professionals, and women themselves for improving the national health through <em>family planning</em>. By the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, this new brand of sexology had become an important tool for advocates of birth control.</p>

        <p><h2>The new sexology</h2></p>

        <p>In practice, birth control (also known as family planning) goes back thousands of years, covering a range of techniques and treatments with which women have attempted to prevent conception or birth. In the late nineteenth century, a radical alliance of sexologists and birth control campaigners began claiming that reproduction was a matter of public health, and that lack of adequate measures for birth control contributed to poverty and undermined social progress. Their arguments were considered obscene by many in that they accepted a non‐procreative dimension of human sexuality. This was a controversial subject in the legal climate after 1870. In the United States the Comstock Act of 1873 had prohibited the distribution of information about contraception or abortion. In England, Annie Besant (1847−1933) and Charles Bradlaugh (1833−1891) were successfully prosecuted in 1877 for publishing Charles Knowlton's manual <em>The Fruits of Philosophy</em> (1832), which detailed techniques for avoiding pregnancy. The birth control movement arose in this climate in order to combat these legal trends. After the Besant−Bradlaugh trial, organizations under the umbrella name of the Malthusian League were formed in a number of European capitals to campaign for public discussion of birth control, signaling the emergence of a "modern sexual ethos" that accepted and promoted non‐procreative sex as normal and healthy (<a href="oosterhus2000">Oosterhus 2000</a>). Sexology in this period became an important tool for birth control reformers who hoped to provide the public with medical and scientific arguments to counter legal and moral proscriptions against contraception.</p>

        <p><em>Studies in the Psychology of Sex</em> by the British physician Havelock Ellis (1859−1939) is a six‐volume work published over the period 1897−1910. It reveals the radical transformation of sexology in this period. Earlier volumes focus on sexual "inversion" (homosexuality), while the last volume openly promotes non‐procreative sex in marriage, warns against sexual abstinence (implying the necessity of contraception), and calls for medical over criminal measures to combat venereal diseases and regulate the birth rate (<a href="#ellis1910">Ellis 1910</a>). Drawing heavily on Darwinian evolutionary theory, neo‐Malthusian demography, and eugenics, the new sexology claimed that by limiting their birthrates, powerful nations could improve the strength and quality of their racial stock. This provided the twentieth‐century birth control movement with a powerful argument: birth control was a Malthusian check on population growth, a natural continuation, according to Ellis, of the evolutionary process itself (<a href="#ellis1917">Ellis 1917</a>).</p>

        <p><h2>Sexology and the birth control movement</h2></p>

        <p>The so‐called "birth control" movement of the early twentieth century was a broad, transnational movement to challenge anti‐obscenity laws and provide women with the means to limit their number of pregnancies. Pioneers of the movement in the English‐speaking world, such as Margaret Sanger (1879−1966) and Marie Stopes (1880−1958), drew on the work of sexologists like Havelock Ellis to justify their cause scientifically (<a href="#jones1997">Jones 1997</a>). Sanger painted a bleak picture of unqualified practitioners attempting abortions, causing the "wrecked health and death" of women and the birth of countless unwanted children (Sanger 1930). In 1916 Sanger founded the first birth control clinic in the United States (located in New York City) and the American Birth Control League in 1921. The 1920s saw a period of growing support for the movement and birth control clinics were opened in Europe, North America, and in the colonies, though subject to surveillance and closure. The clinics were dedicated to the dual tasks of sex education and family planning, promoting contraceptive <em>devices</em> (such as the diaphragm) over contraceptive <em>methods</em> (such as premature withdrawal and vaginal douching). A total of seven international conferences on birth control were held in Europe and North America between 1900 and 1930. However, the interwar period also witnessed a backlash against birth control, with political parties capitalizing freely on falling birth rates and so‐called race suicide. In 1936, Joseph Stalin criminalized abortion in the Soviet Union (it had been legalized by the Bolsheviks in 1920), while Nazi Germany began legalizing abortion for women not of "German stock", revealing the complex racial politics of birth control in this period (<em>Bock 1983</em>).</p>

        <p><h2>Sexology and birth control after World War II</h2></p>

        <p>After the war, there was a renewed interest in sexology, especially in North America where Alfred Kinsey (1894−1956) dominated the field. Kinsey drew directly on the statistical data developed by Sanger and researchers at Sanger's New York clinic, where studies had been compiled throughout the 1920s and 1930s recording the frequency of patients’ sexual intercourse, their experience of orgasm, and their use of contraception. Findings were presented in factual, value‐neutral, scientific language. Kinsey's much publicized and controversial Reports, <em>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</em> (<a href="#kinsey1948">Kinsey et al. 1948</a>) and <em>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</em> (<a href="kinsey1953">Kinsey et al. 1953</a>), drew on Sanger's work in both style and content, discussing people's sex lives in technical detail, without moral judgment, and including their contraceptive practices. The sexology of the Kinsey era changed postwar cultural attitudes to birth control, presenting it as a normal aspect of healthy human sexual practice, which should not be judged negatively according to religious or moral sensibilities.</p>

        <p>Arguably, the sexology of the Kinsey era also shaped the economic world, facilitating the transformation of sexuality into an array of consumer goods. The birth control pill, developed in the 1950s and marketed in the 1960s, was a sexual commodity enjoyed by growing numbers of middle‐class women in a period of general prosperity and economic growth in industrialized countries. The alliance of twentieth‐century sexology and the birth control movement also powerfully impacted feminist politics in the 1960s and 1970s, which prioritized the reproductive autonomy of women. While Maoist China in this period openly embraced state‐supported birth control on the basis of eugenics arguments (using early twentieth‐century sexological arguments equating quality of life with checks on population growth), in Euro‐American countries access to contraception and abortion was increasingly presented as a woman's civil right; in the United States a landmark ruling was that of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> (1973), which stated that a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy came under her "right to privac"y.</p>

        <p><h2>Sexology and the birth control movement today</h2></p>

        <p>Many of the tenets first tentatively expressed by early twentieth‐century sexologists are culturally accepted today in the mainstream media of many Euro‐American countries: human sexuality is openly discussed in detail; regular, non‐procreative sexual activity is considered healthy and normal; and contraception and abortion are readily available. Yet, many people continue to hold religious and moral convictions that sex with another person is primarily a procreative and sacred act within marriage. Science, for some, is not competent to address such powerful moral questions as when a fetus becomes a human being with a legally protected right to life. Divisions persist between those who see access to abortion and contraception as promoting an irresponsible culture of promiscuity and sexual degeneracy, and those who see them as an important dimension of women's civil rights and individual sexual freedom. The argument that birth control is a matter of public health evokes eugenics arguments of race and class supremacy that many find repugnant. Yet concerns are regularly voiced in public media over the high birth rates that characterize immigrant and poor urban populations and the debates continue. Birth control remains controversial today; perhaps more so, since it is no longer clear to what extent questions about human sexual behavior can be answered by recourse to science.</p>
