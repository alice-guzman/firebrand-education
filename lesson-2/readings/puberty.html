        <p>1000 THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Puberty</strong> is the time when girls and boys mature sexually.</li>
          <li><strong>The age of puberty varies:</strong> on average it is between 10 and 13 years for girls, and between 11 and 15 years for boys.</li>
          <li><strong>Puberty is started</strong> by two hormones sent out by the pituitary gland (see The brain): the follicle-stimulating hormone and the luteinizing hormone.</li>
        </ul>

        <figcaption>In their early teens, girls go through puberty and begin to develop the sexual characteristics that will make them women.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>During puberty, a girl</strong> will develop breasts and grow hair under her arms and around her genitals.</li>
          <li><strong>Inside her body,</strong> a girl's ovaries grow ten times as big and release sex hormones (see Reproduction: females).</li>
          <li><strong>The sex hormones</strong> estrogen and progesterone spur the development of a girl's sexual organs and control her monthly menstrual cycle.</li>
          <li><strong>A year or so after puberty begins,</strong> a girl has her menarche (the first menstrual period). When her periods come regularly, she is able to have a baby.</li>
          <li><strong>For a boy during puberty,</strong> his testes grow and hair sprouts on his face, under his arms, and around his genitals. His voice also becomes lower (see Reproduction: male).</li>
          <li><strong>Inside his body,</strong> a boy's testes begin to make sperm.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h2>STAR FACT</h2></p>

        <p>By the time a boy is 15, his testicles can make 200 million new sperm a day.</p>
