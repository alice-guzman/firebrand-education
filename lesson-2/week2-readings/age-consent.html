        <p style="margin-top: 0;">Statutory rape is sexual intercourse with an unmarried person who is under the "age of consent". Force is not required; the crime lies solely with the age of the victim. This age differs around the world, but tends to range from 14 to 18. The laws presume that young people are too immature and vulnerable to give valid consent to sexual intercourse, and so they attempt to protect young people by deterring those who might take advantage of that immaturity. The laws can indeed punish those who have committed sexual abuse against young people. But they can, and have, served to punish consensual sexual activity among adolescents as well.</p>

        <p>There are many "ages of consent", but the most common use of the phrase is in defining the age at which a person can legally consent to sexual activity with someone to whom he or she is not married. Age of consent laws are also called statutory rape laws. Statutory rape is the crime of having sex with an underage person. The age varies from country to country, and in the United States, the age varies across the states.</p>

        <p>In Europe and the United States the laws were originally gender‐specific and remained so until the late twentieth century. England codified its statutory rape law in the Statute of Westminster of 1275, setting the age at 12 (Statute of Westminster I, 3 Edw., c. 13 (1275)). It was lowered to ten in 1576, "... if any person shall unlawfully and carnally know and abuse any woman‐child under the age of ten years, every such unlawful and carnal knowledge shall be a felony" (18 Eliz., ch. 7 §4 (1576)).</p>

        <p>The American colonies imported many laws from England, and statutory rape laws were no exception. Most set the age of consent at 10 or 12. The laws at that time were less about the female's ability to consent and more about protecting her virginity until marriage. So, "statutory rape was a property crime" (<a href="#eidson1980">Eidson 1980</a> :767; <a href="#fuentes1994">Fuentes 1994</a>) because it was the theft of an unmarried (white) female's virginity—her father's property.</p>

        <p><h2>Reform in the late nineteenth century</h2></p>

        <p>In England, the age was raised to 13 in 1875 and again to 16 in 1885. Beginning in the 1880s in the United States, the laws were changed in virtually every state. In both countries the changes were pushed for in the context of public anxieties over urbanization, industrialization, and shifting gender and sexual identities, and were finally sparked by the publication of a tract purporting to expose the "white slave traffic" of young girls into prostitution. In the United States anxieties over immigration added to the concerns. Strange bedfellows began to coalesce around the issue: first‐wave feminists, white working‐class men's organizations, and religious conservatives worked together to raise the age of consent.</p>

        <p>White middle‐class female reformers were concerned about the morality of the working class and new immigrants. They viewed young people going to the pub, or to the movies, or to dances together as symbols of moral decline, and sought to portray a married domestic life as the ultimate goal to which a girl should aspire. They sought to "uplift" working girls’ morals so that they might adopt "American" middle‐class values. These reformers were also concerned with the potential for young females to be abused by predatory males, both within and outside the family. Thus, the reformers were also concerned with the sexual double standard that demanded female chastity before marriage yet allowed men access to those above age 10 or 12 without fear of repercussions. They constructed a narrative in which affluent males tricked or forced young working females into sex. They wanted an acknowledgment of sexual danger, at least that facing young white females (<a href="#dubois1984">DuBois and Gordon 1984</a>; <a href="#kunzel1993">Kunzel 1993</a>; <a href="#langum1995">Langum 1995</a>; <a href="#larson1997">Larson 1997</a>; <a href="#odem1995">Odem 1995</a>; <a href="#peiss1986">Peiss 1986</a>; <a href="#stansell1987">Stansell 1987</a>; <a href="#walkowitz1980">Walkowitz 1980</a>, <a href="#walkowitz1992">1992</a>).</p>

        <p>The image of the passive white working‐class victim was supported by white working‐class men, as well by more conservative religious men and women, and thus merged social conservatism with protectionist instincts. But they did not share the feminists’ interest in reforming working‐class morals. They were more concerned with proscribing premarital sexuality, and particularly female sexuality (<a href="#kunzel1993">Kunzel 1993</a>; <a href="#oodem1995">Odem 1995</a>; <a href="#olsen1984">Olsen 1984</a>; <a href="#walkowitz1980">Walkowitz 1980</a>).</p>

        <p>Led by the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), which had broadened its anti‐alcohol stance to combat what it saw as other types of immorality, those described above lobbied to have “the age at which a girl can legally consent to her own ruin be raised to at least eighteen years" (<a href="#larson1997">Larson 1997</a>; <a href="#wctu1888">WCTU Petition 1888</a>). All states did raise the age, to 16 or 18.</p>

        <p>Male legislators made the changes in order to publicly claim they were protecting young women, but they did not take much of this seriously. They almost immediately made the crime virtually impossible to prosecute, in three ways: (1) they graded the penalties so that underage males would receive a more lenient sentence; (2) they required that female victims be "of previously chaste character" (i.e., a virgin) for the crime to have occurred; and (3) they codified a "mistake of age" defense—there could be no conviction if the accused said he believed the victim was above the age of consent (<a href="#larson1997">Larson 1997</a>; <a href="#pivar1973">Pivar 1973</a>).</p>

        <p>In effect, the raising of the age of consent and the "chaste character" defense made what was a crime about "stealing" the virginity of a female of 10 or 12 into a crime about stealing the virginity of a female of 16 or 18. From this point, then, one could be old enough to marry and thus have sexual intercourse legally, but not old enough to consent to unmarried sex. From the Victorian era through to the 1950s (the latter of which was the twentieth century's high point for teen births, triple that of today), many young males and females were married and had children before they reached the new higher ages of consent.</p>

        <p>After the turn of the century, activities centered on statutory rape laws began to take a more conservative turn. Middle‐class female reformers had begun to discover that some working‐class females were not unwilling participants in sexual activity and sought to "rehabilitate" them through reformatories that taught them domestic work. Second, male police, prosecutors, and judges were less prone to see young females as victims and would often sentence the male defendant to probation while sentencing the female on delinquency charges and sending her to a reformatory. Third, families began to use the laws to try to control their "incorrigible" daughters, pushing them into the system due to their sexuality. These young women were for the most part poor and of immigrant descent or status (<a href="#alexander1995">Alexander 1995</a>; <a href="#kunzel1993">Kunzel 1993</a>; <a href="#larson1997">Larson 1997</a>; <a href="#odem1995">Odem 1995</a>; <a href="scholossman1979">Schlossman and Wallach 1979</a>; <a href="#stansell1987">Stansell 1987</a>).</p>

        <p><h2>Reforms of the 1970s</h2></p>

        <p>Statutory rape reform was part of a larger program of forcible rape reform begun by second‐wave feminists in 1973. They saw statutory rape laws less as protective and more as punitive. They felt that the nineteenth‐century feminists had in some ways codified patriarchal notions of female sexuality and mental incapacity into law and thus reinforced gender stereotypes. They also felt that the first‐wave feminists’ discourses were restrictive in their advocacy for passivity and chastity, and their implication that sexuality be confined to heterosexual marriage. Some of their specific goals for amending statutory rape laws included eliminating the "promiscuity" clause that dismissed cases if the young female was not a virgin and removing the "mistake of age" defense in which the perpetrator could claim he believed the victim was above the age of consent.</p>

        <p>But these feminists also felt that the shortcomings of forcible rape law showed the necessity of statutory rape law to prosecute sex with underage people that fell short of the legal definitions and cultural conceptions of forcible rape. In the 1970s, and to some extent still today, juries were likely to assume not only that the crime of forcible rape required an armed male stranger as the perpetrator, but also that a victim show that she resisted her attacker. In a statutory rape case, the prosecution has to prove only that the victim was under age and that the two people were not married when the sexual act occurred. Statutory rape is simply easier to prosecute than is forcible rape.</p>

        <p>Liberal feminists thus sought to restore some agency to young women while also safeguarding them from sexual coercion. They lobbied for gender‐neutral language to protect both males and females. Thus the crime would be based solely on the age of the victim, not both age and gender. They also lobbied for age‐span provisions so that the perpetrator would have to be a certain number of years older than the victim; therefore, sex between teens of a similar age would go unprosecuted. The idea here is that a young person could be more easily taken advantage of by someone who was older (<a href="#bienen1980">Bienen 1980</a>:177 − 180; <a href="#searles1987">Searles and Berger 1987</a>:25 − 27).</p>

        <p>However, radical feminists argued that for socially constructed reasons, men and women were simply not similarly situated in modern society, that a female was always the less powerful party in heterosexual relationships, and that a young female's non‐consent may manifest in a way not recognized in forcible rape laws (see, e.g., <a href="#mackinnon1991">MacKinnon 1991</a>). Formal equality in the law and age spans would do little to change this (see <a href="#oberman1994">Oberman 1994</a>).</p>

        <p>On the opposite side of the debate were the sex radicals, sometimes called pro‐sex feminists. They were concerned that the laws punished consensual unmarried sex, painted all young people, and particularly young females, as incapable of making decisions about their own bodies, and sent a message that non‐marital sex and female sexual agency were in and of themselves problematic (see, e.g., Duggan and Hunter 1985; <a href="#rubin1984">Rubin 1984</a>). They, and gay/lesbian/queer activists, also feared that gender‐neutral laws would enable the prosecution of same‐sex couples. Indeed, until the last few years, many European countries maintained two sets of ages of consent: one for male–female sex and one for male–male sex (<a href="#shvartsman2004">Shvartsman 2004</a>; see also <a href="#graupner2000">Graupner 2000</a>). England, for instance, had 21 as its age of consent for two men from 1967 (the year when consensual male–male sex was decriminalized under the Sexual Offences Act 1967); it was reduced to 18 in 1994, and to 16—the same as that for two people of the opposite sex—in 2003 (<a href="#waites2005">Waites 2005</a>).</p>

        <p>Each U.S. state had adopted gender‐neutral language by 2000. A law which formerly stated that "a male commits the crime of statutory rape if he engages in sexual intercourse with a female not his wife and under the age of consent" now reads "a person commits the crime of statutory rape if he or she engages in sexual intercourse with a person not his or her spouse under the age of consent ..."</p>

        <p>More cases can be prosecuted with gender‐neutral language, thus potentially protecting more young people. But there has been a disproportionate increase in cases involving two people of the same sex (<a href="#meidinger2012">Meidinger 2012</a>; see also <a href="#fischdel2010">Fischel 2010</a>), leading to media coverage that tends to be quite negative and includes the word "pedophile" to describe the older person, particularly if he is male. Cases involving female perpetrators and male victims are often framed differently; more often than not, the young male is assumed not to have been harmed and the older female is assumed to have been in love. These situations tend to reflect the gender stereotypes of the law's former gender‐specific wording—that a male is sexually aggressive while a female is sexually passive.</p>

        <p>Thirty‐six states have 16 as their age of consent; six have 18; six have 17; two have 15. In most European countries, the age is 15 or 16. In general, the age ranges from 14 to 18 in most countries that have codified such an age.</p>

        <p>Age‐span provisions have been adopted by all but three U.S. states (Kansas, Massachusetts, and Wisconsin). The spans are most commonly three or four years, but vary from two to seven years across the states. Some specify a minimum age for the perpetrator. A law today might read: "A person commits the crime of statutory rape when he or she engages in sexual intercourse with a person not his or her spouse and under the age of 16, provided he or she is at least 18". Such a state could treat as the same the 18‐year‐old in a relationship with an almost 16‐year‐old, and the 50‐year‐old stranger who abuses a 5‐year‐old—both may be required to register as sex offenders and notify their communities of their crime (<a href="#garfinkle2003">Garfinkle 2003</a>; <a href="#goodwin2013">Goodwin 2013</a>). Both may be subject to confinement and/or psychiatric treatment to "cure" such urges as part of their prison term, parole, or probation. Both are perpetrators of felony‐level statutory rape.</p>

        <p><h2>Statutory rape, teen pregnancy, and welfare in the 1980s–2000s</h2></p>

        <p>In 1981, the U.S. Supreme Court heard its only case dealing with statutory rape laws, <em>Michael M. v. Superior Court of Sonoma County</em> (450 US 464‐502 (1981)). The majority of the court held that gender‐specific statutory rape laws, in which only males were considered perpetrators, were constitutional because they served to deter the "epidemic" of teenage pregnancy. Young females were, or should be, deterred from sex by the threat of pregnancy, and young males would be deterred from sex by the fear of prosecution. Statutory rape laws, then, would serve to reduce teen pregnancy. In making this much‐criticized argument, the court explicitly linked teen pregnancy, statutory rape, and adolescent sexuality.</p>

        <p>At the same time a broader backlash was taking place against longer‐term changes in the United States which had begun in the 1960s and 1970s. Conservatives in the 1980s focused on the rising numbers of non‐marital sexual relationships and out‐of‐wedlock births and on the concurrently rising percentage of women and children living in poverty who required public assistance; indeed, they basically said that the former, particularly among people of color, caused the latter (see, e.g., <a href="#murray1984">Murray 1984</a>).</p>

        <p>This type of discourse intensified in 1995, when the nonpartisan Guttmacher Institute released a study, <em>Sex and America's Teenagers</em> (1994), on teen pregnancy. It found that 65 percent of teen mothers had children by men aged 20 or older and that, not infrequently, the younger the mother, the larger the age gap between her and the baby's father. That study itself, as well as subsequent studies, also showed: (1) About 60 percent of these teen mothers were aged 18 or 19 with partners of 20 or 21, and many of them were married; (2) about 50 percent of the 15–17‐year‐old mothers had a same‐age partner, with another 30 percent having a partner within 3–5 years of their age, and many of them were married; and (3) therefore, only about 8 percent of all 15–19 year olds who gave birth were in a relationship with someone five or more years older, and were unmarried (e.g., <a href="#saul1999">Saul 1999</a>; <a href="#urban1997">Urban Institute 1997</a>). Nevertheless, these findings were ignored and calls for stemming the tide of teen pregnancy grew louder. Some public officials began to argue that punishing statutory rape would result in fewer unmarried teen births and thus reduce the public assistance rolls.</p>

        <p>The following year, the new Republican‐controlled Congress legislated welfare reform in the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA, P.L.104‒193). The opening sentence of the PRWORA says nothing about poverty. Instead, it asserts that "Marriage is the foundation of a successful society". Shortly thereafter, it adds: "The increase in the number of children receiving public assistance is closely related to the increase in births to unmarried women ... The increase of teenage pregnancies among the youngest girls is particularly severe and is linked to predatory sexual practices by men who are significantly older ... Available data suggests that almost 70 percent of births to teenage girls are fathered by men over age 20 ..."" Presumably Congress' source for this figure was the Guttmacher Institute study.</p>

        <p>The Welfare Reform Act then challenges each state to submit plans on how it will "prevent and reduce the incidence of out‐of wedlock pregnancies ... [and provide] education and training on the problem of statutory rape so that teenage pregnancy prevention programs may be expanded in scope to include men" (P.L. 104‒193, Section 402 (a) (1), (v) and (vi)). Up to five states each year can receive bonuses of up to $100 million if they have the highest rates of decrease in both illegitimate births and abortions. Ten states passed laws allotting millions of dollars to targeting the partners of pregnant teens. These states increased statutory rape prosecutions in three ways: (1) by linking statutory rape and child abuse, thereby requiring teachers and others to report suspected cases; (2) by requiring those who apply for Medicaid to identify their partners in order to receive assistance; and (3) by requiring healthcare providers to report to state authorities any suspicions they have of statutory rape. They have also, along with several other states, created taskforces on statutory rape and out‐of‐wedlock pregnancy. Some have spent millions conducting outreach campaigns consisting of websites, pamphlets, and billboards.</p>

        <p>Not noted was the fact that only about 1 percent of mothers receiving public assistance are under age 18; or that the teen birthrate in 1996 was less than half that of the twentieth century's peak in 1957; or that the married teen birthrate is about ten times higher than the unmarried teen birthrate; or that two‐thirds of teen mothers are 18 or 19; or that most unmarried mothers are women in their twenties who do not require public assistance. Reinvigorating statutory rape laws, therefore, could not access the vast majority of relationships resulting in out‐of‐wedlock children, impact teen pregnancy, reduce the welfare rolls, or reduce poverty (<a href="#cocca2004">Cocca 2004</a>).</p>

        <p>Groups such as the National Organization for Women protested the Welfare Reform Act. Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union, among others, testified against it. These groups expressed a number of concerns vis‐à‐vis statutory rape and teen pregnancy. Mainly, they argued, same‐age relationships which do <em>not</em> result in pregnancy might be nonconsensual, and age‐differentiated relationships which do result in pregnancy might be consensual and long‐term, but the newly revised laws would not catch the first instance and would punish the second (<a href="#cocca2004">Cocca 2004</a>; <a href="#donovan1997">Donovan 1997</a>; <a href="#elders1998">Elders and Albert 1998</a>).</p>

        <p>The links forged between statutory rape, the rate of births to teen mothers, and public assistance expenditures served to reinvigorate prosecutorial efforts toward the crime, while also undermining the gender‐neutral language of the laws by focusing on young women as victims. In recent years, the "pregnancy" discourse has abated, replaced by stated concern for protecting adolescents from exploitation. But that concern may manifest itself differently, based on the race and sexuality of the parties involved (<a href="#goodwin2013">Goodwin 2013</a>; <a href="#meidinger2012">Meidinger 2012</a>).</p>

        <p>As has always been the case, the implementation of the laws tends to have mixed results—they are both protective (if indeed a young person is being abused) and punitive (if the relationship is consensual). The question remains how one can maintain or increase protection for young people against sexual abuse, while allowing consensual sexual activity.</p>
